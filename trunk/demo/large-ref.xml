<seg id="1"> Lack of snow in mountains causes problems for hoteliers </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It&apos;s not only Krkonoše ski-lift operators who are worried by these bare slopes. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The lack of snow is putting people off booking ski holidays in hotels and guest houses. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This means vacancies are still available in the Krkonoše throughout the winter, including Christmas and New Year&apos;s Eve. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> We&apos;re getting plenty of visitors to our site. </seg>
<seg id="6"> People are browsing the offers, checking prices, but, so far, are worried about making a definite booking. </seg>
<seg id="7"> &quot;When they call, the first thing they ask is if we think they&apos;ll see snow or mud,&quot; says Martin Jandura, who runs the Spindl.Info information web site. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Anyone who wants to spend New Year&apos;s Eve in Špindlerův Mlýn just how they want, had better start thinking about booking soon. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Those preferring to save money and go for cheaper accommodation can still give it a few days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Hoteliers in Špindlerův Mlýn are so far just offering week-long stays for New Year&apos;s Eve. </seg>
<seg id="11"> I think they&apos;ll try to keep that up for a while, but even they will give in and offer shorter stays. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Then there&apos;ll be a sudden shortage of vacancies,&quot; estimates Jandura. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Vrchlabí travel agency Ingtours is still offering vacancies throughout the winter. </seg>
<seg id="14"> What we’re interested in is Christmas week, which hasn&apos;t sold out yet. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Half of our capacity is still available. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That&apos;s why we&apos;ve been preparing some cheaper last-minute Christmas breaks,&quot; said Ingtours director Petr Schiefert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The Vrchlabí travel agency can still offer New Year&apos;s Eve in the Krkonoše, but there are fewer vacancies. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Another good time for bookings is the first fortnight in February, although bookings for the remaining winter dates tend to be average. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> This year, interest in winter breaks is low due to the fact that there is still no snow on the Krkonoše. </seg>
<seg id="20"> People are waiting to see if any falls. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nobody wants to spend the end of the year in the mountains when there&apos;s no snow. </seg>
<seg id="22"> If snow falls on the slopes this week, Christmas will sell out too,&quot; says Schiefert. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> On the other hand, the Horizont Hotel in Pec pod Sněžkou has seen better bookings this year than last year. </seg>
<seg id="24"> We&apos;re up about 5 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> We have the last few vacancies for New Year&apos;s Eve and Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="26"> There&apos;s a lot of interest during the Polish holidays in January and we usually get plenty of bookings in February too,&quot; explains the director of the best hotel in Pec, Karel Rada. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The Omnia Hotel, by the central car park in Janské Lázně, is eighty-percent booked up for New Year&apos;s Eve. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Yet the newest hotel in Janské Lázně still has half its beds free for Christmas. </seg>
<seg id="29"> January this year has been a nice surprise, as we&apos;re already sixty-percent booked up. </seg>
<seg id="30"> So February isn&apos;t looking quite so good, but as soon as it snows, then interest in staying in the Krkonoše will definitely rise, says the owner of the Omnia Hotel, Erik Sporysch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> For now, however, the Krkonoše hoteliers will have to wait for heavier falls of snow. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Colder weather is forecast for Thursday, so if anything falls, it should be snow. </seg>
<seg id="33"> But it should get warmer again after that, said Jiří Jakubský of the Czech Hydrometeorological Institute in Hradec. </seg>

<seg id="1"> USA: Repetition is the mother of wisdom </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It&apos;s almost funny to see how Barack Obama, reputedly the wisest president, is trying so hard in the matter of the Afghan war to repeat the strategy of his predecessor, having himself considered him to be the most foolish. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> When he finally came out with his long-awaited Afghan doctrine, it appeared that he had made a carbon copy of Bush&apos;s Iraq scenario three years earlier. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It&apos;s not just that in the text itself he repeatedly uses the words &quot;just like in Iraq&quot;, but he even went as far as to use the name of Bush&apos;s declaration from January 2007 as the title of his own declaration:&quot;The new way forward&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> While three years ago he himself criticised Bush&apos;s idea to send fresh troops to help in the beleaguered civil war in Iraq as &quot;an irresponsible decision with catastrophic consequences&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The following months, however, showed that Bush&apos;s strategy, which was recommended by his field commanders, was the only possible course of action and so successful that there are no reports in the news about Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="7"> It didn&apos;t help Bush&apos;s reputation, but in objective terms, it left his successor in a much more favourable position than might be expected. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Barack Obama hopes that, in Afghanistan, the miracle will repeat itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> He was again asked to increase the military contingent by his field commanders, particularly the supreme commander of the Afghan operation General Stanley McChrystal, who even went against the custom of his subordinates to harshly criticise the reluctant gunners in the White House. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He asked for 40 thousand men to turn the situation around. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The president hesitated for three months, but failed to come up with anything better, and so at least the general did out of 10 thousand soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He managed to squeeze a promise out of Europe for another 5 thousand, even though he himself was originally counting on 10. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The trickiest aspect of Obama&apos;s strategy seems to be his plan to start pulling troops out of Afghanistan within 18 months and to finish the process within three years. Obama&apos;s doctrine as a whole calls for more questions than it answers. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Many doubt that this half-hearted increase will bear the same fruit as the action plan in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Despite the internecine war of recent years, Iraqi society is relatively firm on its feet and its leaders have been honouring the treaties. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Afghan situation is just the opposite - nobody can be relied upon and no treaties are being upheld. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In these conditions, it is hard for the Afghan security forces to prepare, being so used to changing leaders to suit themselves. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Political institutions, no matter how formally they might be set up, will be nothing more than a Potemkin village in which patriarchal tribal relations will run wild. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Balancing the interests of a variety of ethnic groups is unusually difficult due to the tricky relations between them, a fact which is further complicated by the influence of Pakistan and Iran. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Even building an &quot;operational state&quot;, which is the most basic aim of the entire operation, does not seem particularly feasible. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The timing of Obama&apos;s strategy is foiled by his voluntarism. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Over the last eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has just gotten worse and worse, and is now on the verge of exploding. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Only a truly romantic soul, totally unaffected by reality, could believe that the soldiers sent into the turmoil of this war for an &quot;early return home&quot; will bring about any miracles here. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> From a political viewpoin,t it is pure irresponsibility setting a date for withdrawing the troops, as the Taliban will see it as indirect acknowledgement of an American defeat. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The last NATO summit showed that the willingness of the European people to take part in the operations in Afghanistan is waning. </seg>
<seg id="26"> European politicians cannot and are unwilling to explain to voters what the security of Germany or Italy has to do with the war in the foothills of the Hindu Kush. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Another factor which could radically stir things up is what is going on around Iran. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If the situation continues to get worse and increased sanctions against Iran have no effect, the United States will face the difficult question of whether to try to resolve the situation using military force or not. </seg>
<seg id="29"> This will need answering when, according to Obama, America orders the victorious withdrawal of its troops from Afghanistan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Any such solution will obviously also mean a dramatic turnaround in the Afghan situation. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The only saving grace for Barack Obama is the fact that there are three more years to the presidential elections, so there&apos;s still enough time for him to come up with another strategyif this one turns out to be a total whitewash. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Managers at Goldman Sachs no longer to receive cash bonuses </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The top management of the American bank Goldman Sachs will not receive their bonuses in cash this year. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The announcement came from the company as a reaction to the harsh criticism of their salary policies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Instead of money, the group of 30 top managers will receive shares, which cannot be sold for another five years. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The shares can also be confiscated if the managers take excessive risks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> According to Reuters, Goldman Sachs is leading the effort to link Wall Street bonuses with long-term performance. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I assume that Wall Street is well aware of the broader path it has to take, said former investment banker for JPMorgan, Douglas Elliott. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The problem lies in the details, he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Goldman Sachshas been targeted by critics since it set aside almost 17 billion dollars (almost 300 billion crowns) for bonuses in the first three quarters of this year. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Reuters claims that the total bonuses awarded by the business this year, despite today&apos;s announcement, exceeds 20 billion dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> High bonuses in the banking sector, what with the economic crisis, have become a political hot potato. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On Wednesday, Britain announced that it had decided to charge a one-off fifty percent tax rate on bankers&apos; bonuses exceeding 25,000 pounds (around 712,000 CZK). </seg>
<seg id="13"> France is preparing similar measures. </seg>

<seg id="1"> This year, women were awarded the Nobel Prize in all fields except physics </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In Stockholm today, a record five women received Nobel Prizes from the Swedish king Carl XVI Gustaf in the professional categories and for literature. </seg>
<seg id="3"> In addition to four scientists, they also included the German writer Herta Müller, originally from Romania. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Nobel Prize for medicine went to two American biologists, Elizabeth Blackburn and Carol Greider, together with their fellow countryman Jack Szostak, for their research in chromosomes. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The prize for chemistry was won by the Israeli Ada Jonath, together with the Americans Venkatraman Ramakrishnan and Thomas Steitz, for their work to clarify the structure and function of ribosomes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The last award was the Nobel Prize for Economics, which went to the Americans Elinor Ostrom and Oliver Williamson for their analysis of economic management. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The only specialised category which nobody won this year was physics. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Today, this prize was won by the scientists Charles Kao, for his research in optical fibres, and George Smith and Willard Boyle, for inventing the CCD ship, which is the basis for all digital cameras, faxes, and astronomical telescopes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> All the winners received a diploma, the Nobel Medal, and a certificate for a monetary reward. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In each category, this award totals ten million Swedish krona (approximately 25 million CZK). </seg>
<seg id="11"> If there are multiple winners, they share the prize money between them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Traditionally, the most highly-anticipated award, the Nobel Peace Prize, went to the American president Barack Obama in the Norwegian city of Oslo this afternoon. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his speech, he acknowledged that the award was controversial, as he is just starting out in office and, moreover, heads a country which is currently at war in two countries - Iraq and Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In defence of his policy he added, however, that these wars were essential in order to bring about peace, despite the high cost. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Minister Janota considers resignation. Klaus invites him to the Castle </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> On Friday morning, President Václav Klaus will meet with the finance minister Eduard Janota, who is considering resigning as he does not agree with the government&apos;s budget for next year as approved on Wednesday by the Chamber of Deputies. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is assumed that the budget and also Janota&apos;s possible continuation in office will be the topic of Friday&apos;s meeting. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The budget has also been criticised by Klaus. </seg>
<seg id="5"> He claims the deficit is too high, which is worsening the public funding crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The meeting was announced by the president&apos;s spokesman Radim Ochvat. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Janota wants to discuss his future on Monday with the Prime Minister, Jan Fischer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> According to the Budget Act, which Klaus is due to sign, the Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns. </seg>
<seg id="9"> However, on Wednesday, the House approved the left&apos;s proposals to transfer funds, gave state employees a pay rise, and allocated extra money for social services and for direct payments to farmers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The government criticised the social democrats&apos; proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> A bitter political dispute has broken out between the left on the one hand, and the government, Klaus, and the right on the other, leading to questions about the future of Fischer&apos;s interim government, which was agreed on in spring by the ODS, ČSSD and Green Party. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Critics claim that the budget, as approved by the House, essentially does away with the package of saving measures put into effect by Fischer&apos;s government in autumn and which it believes should stop the state falling deeper into debt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> At a breakfast meeting with entrepreneurs today, Klaus, who is behind the state budget law but is not obliged to sign it, declared that politicians have long been neglecting a &quot;serious problem,&quot; which is the &quot;unsustainable deficit level&quot; of public finances. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Now, he claims, there is no good solution to this. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The only thing that could improve the situation is a strong government which could fall back on the broader consensus of the political parties, the president says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> ODS chairman Mirek Topolánek said that it was a terrible budget and that the government should rethink continuing in office. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, told ČTK that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and the Green Party is evidently no longer working. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In response to this, Premier Fischer described this statement as &quot;strong words.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The head of the ČSSD, Jiří Paroubek, reacted to Topolánek by saying that what was terrible was the deficit in the budget prepared by the former Topolánek government for this year, which exceeds 200 billion crowns. </seg>
<seg id="20"> On Wednesday the ČSSD declared the approval of next year&apos;s budget to be a success. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The People&apos;s Party was also satisfied. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Mandela played by Morgan Freeman in Clint Eastwood&apos;s new film </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> South Africans claim that the new Hollywood film Invictus will tell the world a lot about their country, its struggle and its victories, despite some people criticising the fact that the main roles are played by American actors. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is a story about sport, race relations, and Nelson Mandela. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The life of the tireless fighter against the racist system of apartheid in South Africa and its first black president, Nelson Mandela, is played by the Oscar-winning American actor Morgan Freeman. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Freeman said that he had asked ninety-one-year-old Mandela if he could play him in Eastwood&apos;s film. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Another leading role in the film is played by Matt Damon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> I told him: &apos;If I&apos;m going to play you, I&apos;ll need access to you&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The seventy-two-year-old actor, who won an Oscar for his role in Eastwood&apos;s boxing drama Million Dollar Baby, has already played roles such as the leader of the anti-slavery movement who eventually himself became a slave, a fictitious president of the USA, and even a god in Evan Almighty, but has only rarely portrayed someone who is still alive and means so much to people as Mandela. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The former South African statesman spent 27 years in prison for his active role in ending apartheid in South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He was released in 1990 and was then the country&apos;s president for four years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 1993 he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Invictus is Latin for &apos;unconquered&apos; and is the name of a poem by the English writer William Ernest Henley, published in 1875. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The challenge was to speak like he does. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The film tells the true story of how Nelson Mandela joined forces with the captain of the South African rugby team, Francois Pienaar, to help unify the country. The newly-elected President Mandela knows that, after apartheid, his nation will still be racially and economically divided. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He believes that he can unite people through sport, so he decides to unite the rugby players who, to the world, are outsiders. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The South African team eventually makes it through to the World Cup in 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Freeman worked for several years to get Mandela&apos;s story onto the big screen. </seg>
<seg id="18"> My only aim was to play this role as realistically as possible, said Freeman. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Naturally, the greatest challenge was to speak like Mandela. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The actor said that if he and world politicians were in the same ball park, he would try to meet Mandela, go for dinner with him, and be behind the scenes with him before his speeches. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The most important thing was that he wanted to shake Mandela&apos;s hand. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I found out that when I take your hand, I draw on your energy, it flows into me, and I feel that I know how you are feeling, he said. </seg>
<seg id="23"> For me it&apos;s important to try and become a different person. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> In the film, Matt Damon portrays François Pienaar, the captain of the national rugby team, which was dominated by white players. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The actor said that he had six months in the tough world of rugby to prepare for the role. </seg>
<seg id="26"> It turned out to be a great surprise for him when he first met Pienaar at his home. </seg>
<seg id="27"> I remember ringing his doorbell, he opened it, and the very first thing I said to François Pienaar was: &apos;I look much bigger on the screen.&apos; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Despite the evident differences in the stature of the actors compared to their real-life counterparts, under Eastwood&apos;s direction, Invictus has received positive reviews and there is even talk of an Oscar nomination. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Daily Variety film critic Todd McCarthy summed up the film by saying: &quot;It was a great story, a very well-made film.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="30"> In the film reviews on rottentomatoes.com, Invictus has a 76 percent positive rating. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Secret of the glare over Norway solved: the Russians were testing a rocket </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Strange lights of unknown origin have been seen over Norway. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Yesterday the Russian defence ministry finally admitted that it had tested an intercontinental ballistic missile not far from the Norwegian border. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, it was another unsuccessful launch and the missile, which is known as &quot;Bulava&quot; and should have been the pride and glory of the Russian army, has gradually turned into a nightmare for the Russian generals and Prime Minister, Vladimir Putin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> His repeated presence at tests on the rocket has not affected the success rate of the test flights. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The Bulava has generally not lifted off or has been damaged in the air. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The Russian newspapers are describing the &quot;Bulava&quot; as &quot;the flightless rocket.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rocket that doesn&apos;t fly but lights up </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> This, the 13th test, started off according to plan. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But near the end of the flight there was technical damage to the missile. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Apparently the engine blew up in the rocket&apos;s third phase. </seg>
<seg id="12"> This time, the &quot;Bulava&quot; was launched from the atomic submarine Dmitrij Donskij, which was cruising under the surface of the White Sea. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This type of rocket can be launched from a craft which is moving and even submerged. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This makes it likely that the mysterious light over Norway, caused by an unidentified flying object, was actually the malfunctioning &quot;Bulava.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="15"> Anyway, the Norwegians never had any doubts that it was a Russian rocket. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The generals are defending themselves this time though, claiming that it can&apos;t be described as a total failure. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The first two phases of the rocket went well, and the accident happened during the third stage. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Previously, the engines have always malfunctioned during the first phase. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Even though not one test launch has been completely error-free, the defence ministry consider only six out of the thirteen tests to have been failures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The generals are optimistic about this almost fifty-percent success rate and keep insisting that the &quot;Bulava&quot; will eventually fly smoothly and will even carry up to ten hypersonic nuclear blocks weighing a total of 1.15 tons. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Either they&apos;ll claim the additional wage for the overtime or they can take time off in lieu on December 28th and extend their Christmas holiday by one day, said Vaněk. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Additionally, all employees working the Saturday shift will have their travel expenses and lunch paid for. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Considering that overtime was the most pressing and thorny question for the unions, as well as for the protesting employees who brought production to such a grinding halt last week, the management decided yesterday afternoon to immediately cancel all overtime for December, said Vaněk. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Until last week, virtually every day the car plant workers had been forced to do two hours&apos; overtime on top of their normal eight-hour shifts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> After signing the agreement, the trade unions will call off the strike </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Further talks should be held between the car plant management and union leaders on Friday morning. </seg>
<seg id="16"> On Wednesday, the head of the unions, Petr Kuchař, said that if they came to an agreement on the demands and sign the document, they are willing to call off the strike. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The situation at the plant deteriorated sharply last Wednesday when some 400 workers held a spontaneous strike to protest against the incessant overtime. </seg>
<seg id="18"> They were also protesting against bad pay conditions and alleged persecution. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The management responded by saying that employees had to work overtime to meet the demand for cars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> In Monday&apos;s announcement of the strike, the unions also asked that no sanctions be imposed against the workers who halted production last Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The trade unions are asking the firm to keep overtime to a minimum. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Moreover, this year they are requesting that a 5000 crown bonus be paid for this work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The Hyundai car plant in Nošovice now employs 2000 people. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The firm began series production last November. </seg>
<seg id="25"> By this September, it had made around 80,000 cars, and its current capacity is 200,000 vehicles a year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Czech discovery: a substance which works on &apos;tough&apos; forms of the HIV virus </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A team of Czech and German scientists has been testing a new compound which can slow the spread of the HIV virus in the body. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The main advantage of this improved substance is that it also works on viruses which have become immune to medication. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In some cases, this outweighs the fact that the compound used for the normal form of the virus does not have such a strong effect as some drugs that are already available. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> No cure has yet been found for AIDS. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Patients&apos; lives can be greatly prolonged by a mixture of drugs which prevent the HIV virus from multiplying in the body. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, they have a number of side-effects. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Moreover, if the propagation of the virus is not completely suppressed, it can lead to the development of resistant viruses, against which drugs are no longer effective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The work being done by experts from three institutions, the Czech Academy of Sciences, VŠCHT Prague, and the University of Heidelberg, is opening up the way to deal with the rthe virus&apos; resistance. </seg>
<seg id="10"> They have shown that substances known as metallacarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Metallacarboranes are a compound of boron, hydrogen, carbon, and cobalt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> These compounds block the spread of the virus in a different way to all the other drugs in use today, and so they may get over the resistance problem. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In their work, the scientists are coming up with new ‘improved’ compounds, prepared using knowledge of the molecular mechanism and its relation to the virus protein. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Metallacarboranes have a unique three-dimensional structure: two multi-walled cages consisting of boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms are connected to a metal atom, in this case cobalt. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A treacherous and hardy virus </seg>
<seg id="16"> The HIV protease is the protein of the HIV virus, which is essential to the life-cycle of the virus. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The mature infectious viral corpuscles would not occur if the HIV virus was not split by the HIV protease. </seg>
<seg id="18"> If we can stop the HIV protease, we will also stop the virus from spreading through the patient&apos;s body, the scientists explained in a press release published by the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry of the Czech Academy of Sciences. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In a paper published in the Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, the scientists describe a series of compounds in which there are two pairs of cages (see the diagram) connected by a short organic chain, which is then systematically modified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Somewhat weaker, but more reliable </seg>
<seg id="21"> The effectiveness of this series of substances against the HIV protease has been tested in a test-tube, as well as its effectiveness against the more immune(resistant) strain as acquired from patients infected with the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The effect of metallacarboranes on the normal strain of the enzyme is not as strong as that of drugs used in clinical practice, although their effect is not diminished against the resistant strains, whereas drugs currently used are often ineffective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The unique mechanism of the effect and also of its other properties, such as its biological and chemical stability, low toxicity, and the possibility of making other chemical modifications, make metallacarboranes an interesting compound for future research aimed at suggesting new effective drugs to combat HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, head of the Structural Biology laboratory at the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and the Institute of Molecular Genetics of the Academy of Sciences. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Fall-out over the budget. ODS attacks Fischer, who defends himself </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The head of the ODS, Mirek Topolánek, described the next year&apos;s approved budget as &quot;terrible&quot; and said that Premier Jan Fischer&apos;s government should seriously rethink its position in office. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The government chairman described the ODS statement as strong words. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Apparently he will take some time to think about it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The vice-chairman of the ODS, Petr Nečas, said that the concept of an interim government supported by the ČSSD, ODS, and Green Party, was evidently no longer working. </seg>
<seg id="6"> According to Nečas, the government chairman must decide if he intends to fall back on the minority in the House as a fight against the growing deficit, or if he is to stay in office with the help of the parliamentary left. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The approaches taken by the ODS and social democrats on the issue of public deficits are diametrically opposed, remarked Nečas. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On Wednesday, the House accepted the budget for 2010, naturally with the left&apos;s proposed amendments for more than 12 billion crowns. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The House gave extra money for the salaries of state employees, for social services, and for direct payments to farmers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> he government criticised the social democrats&apos; proposals, saying that they will surreptitiously increase the budget deficit. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The Czech Republic should get by with a deficit of 163 billion crowns. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Before the vote, the ODS left the room, complying with the government&apos;s wishes that the amended budget is not as poor an option as the provisional budget. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Disappointment and futility </seg>
<seg id="14"> The finance minister, Eduard Janota, has spoken about his feeling of disappointment and futility, while Premier Jan Fischer said that the government is still assessing the current situation. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Nečas is convinced that if Janota were to really threaten to resign should the proposed amendments be accepted, the situation would look completely different. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> According to Czech Television, Janota has made an appointment to see the Prime Minister on Monday after the session. </seg>
<seg id="17"> At the same time, he indicated that he was rethinking his position in office. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The reason for this is his disappointment in the budget talks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> If Fischer commits himself to continuing the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas believes that the ČSSD appointees who carried through the budget amendments have no place in the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The Prime Minister should also clearly state that he will hand in his resignation if the House approves other laws that will increase the deficit, those relating to sick pay, pensions, or the amendment to the Civil Servants Act for example. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Topolánek: Ministers appointed to the ODS have committed no offence </seg>
<seg id="22"> This is a matter for the ministerial chairman Fischer and the government as a whole. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Ministers appointed to the ODS have done nothing wrong, stressed Topolánek in a text report from the USA. </seg>
<seg id="24"> He pointed out that several ministries employ people in under-secretary positions who support TOP 09, which voted against the budget. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Nečas emphasised that, if Fischer were to decide to resign on the principle of the fight against the public finances deficit, &quot;it is totally logical and correct that he falls back on the left majority currently in the House.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="26"> But then he would not be able to count on the support and tolerance of the civil democrats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> I haven&apos;t thought about it, and I&apos;ll concentrate on that when the time comes, defence minister Martin Barták told reporters in the House, having been elected by the civil democrats. </seg>
<seg id="28"> This afternoon, Prime Minister Fischer flew to Brussels to attend a European Council meeting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> ODS stands down at the request of the Prime Minister </seg>
<seg id="30"> Nečas also stressed that, on Wednesday in the House, the ODS would evidently have voted against the amended budget if the Prime Minister had not explicitly asked the civil democrats to allow the budget to be approved. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> We don&apos;t look like orphans, we&apos;re not little children, was how he reacted to the question of whether the ODS was not hampered by the presence of the party chairman in the parliament and in the Czech Republic during the political negotiations regarding the budget. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I didn&apos;t notice that my vote was missing. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Back when I renounced my mandate, I knew that the following months would see the Bolshevisation of the House and the destruction of all that is positive, Topolánek himself responded. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> From December 13th, Czech Railways will be cancelling or restricting some less frequented express and local trains, but will be adding more services to other lines. </seg>
<seg id="3"> As of the day the new timetable comes into force, there will be two percent fewer services in comparison with now. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Most fares, including basic and special tickets, will stay the same. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> More links to the capital will be available, for example, to the people in the Ostrava region, as the railways are adding one Pendolino to that line. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, the express will stop running to Bratislava. </seg>
<seg id="7"> There will be fewer express trains on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route, and the direct service from Prague - Letohrad will be cut dramatically. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The region planning the greatest transport cuts is the Region of Hradec Králové, with a total cut of eight percent, although Prague and the surrounding area can expect to see a rise. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Two night trains on the Prague - Tábor - České Budějovice line are also being cut, and several express services on the Prague - Písek - České Budějovice route will be reduced to just a few days a week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> One of the greatest changes is the introduction of the new direct line from Milovice to Prague, since people now travelling from Milovice have to change in Lysá nad Labem. </seg>
<seg id="11"> This is the fifteenth line in the Esko suburban system, which can now be opened since the track from Lysá nad Labem to Milovice has been fully electrified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Long-distance services to the capital will end at the Prague Hlavní nádraží station. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Czech Railways is introducing more Pendolino routes between Prague and Ostrava and trains to Šumperk/Jeseník will run on two-hour intervals. </seg>
<seg id="14"> From December 13th, passengers will no longer be able to take Pendolino to Bratislava. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This year&apos;s cost of regional railways: 200 million more </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Express trains are ordered and paid for by the Ministry of Transport, and next year it will give the railways four billion crowns to cover demonstrable losses, the same amount as this year. Local trains are ordered by the regional authorities, who, next year, will pay out a total of eight billion crowns for them, while almost three billion will be contributed by the state. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This year, regional trains are costing 200 million more. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Czech Railways have concluded a new ten-year contract for local and express trains, whereas, previously, the contract was always for one year. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The railways have praised the system, despite the fact that the great majority of fares have not been increased. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The only changes are to ČD Net one-day network tickets and eLiška cheap internet tickets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Travellers without a customer card will find that the ČD Net price has increased from 450 crowns to 600 crowns. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The story of South Africa affects everyone, says Morgan Freeman alias Mandela </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In the next few days, the new Hollywood film Invictus by Clint Eastwood will hit American cinemas, depicting part of the life of the former South African president Nelson Mandela. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The role of the world-famous opponent of apartheid is taken on by Morgan Freeman, who was apparently chosen years ago by Mandela himself for his talent. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The supporting male role of the legendary South African rugby champion Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> With the film in cinemas critics and the public </seg>
<seg id="6"> Nelson Mandela </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Nelson Rolihlahla Mandela was born on July 18th, 1918 in Mvez, in South Africa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In 1988 he was awarded the Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought, and in 1993 received the Nobel Peace Prize with de Klerk. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He was president of South Africa from 1994 to 1999. </seg>
<seg id="10"> There were great expectations, as he appeared in public at a time when not only was South Africa busy preparing for the football world championship, but the media was also rife with worrying news about increasing racial hatred and discrimination by the black majority. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the AP news agency, the response to the new film has so far been generally positive in South Africa, despite the number of objections to &quot;brat-pack&quot; Hollywood stars being cast in the main roles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However, despite what he says, Morgan Freeman is proud of the new film. </seg>
<seg id="13"> I had dreamt about this role for many years and prepared for it well. </seg>
<seg id="14"> I met Nelson Mandela many times to, as they say, draw on his energy, he said in an interview after the film&apos;s grand premiere in Los Angeles. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I think it&apos;s good that we can commemorate Mandela and his mission in a film. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is a story about South Africa, but it affects everybody, he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> In the national rugby team uniform </seg>
<seg id="18"> The film, based on the book by the British writer John Carlin, entitled Playing the Enemy: Nelson Mandela and the Game that Made a Nation, portrays the South African human rights activist during his first presidential election campaign. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In the film, Morgan Freeman tries to unite the two races and the populations that had so long been segregated and, like Nelson Mandela did in 1995, appears in the film in the South African national rugby uniform at the world cup match, which was won by South Africa. </seg>
<seg id="20"> For appearing in the kit, which is an almost sacred symbol in South Africa, fourteen years ago, Mandela received a standing ovation from the predominantly white spectators and gained the esteem of the white people. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Perhaps a football championship can actually bring people together as one nation, said rugby player Chester Williams, who in 1995 was the only black person on the national team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Whether the tense situation in South Africa will improve is only now becoming apparent. </seg>
<seg id="23"> White South Africans, however, are sceptical, as rugby fan Christopher Dawson, who fled the country to go to Britain, admitted in a recent interview for LN. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The championship begins on June 11th, 2010. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> In the morning, a fire broke out in a transformer owned by Čeps at the switching station in the village of Výškov, near Louny. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Six fire engines came out to fight the fire, said the spokesman for the Ústí regional firefighters, Lukáš Marvan. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Originally, the firefighters wanted to let the transformer burn, but later changed their minds and are putting the fire out using a mix of water, foam, and special fire-suppression agents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The fire was caused by a technical fault, a short circuit inside the transformer. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Nobody was hurt, and according to company spokesperson Pavla Mandátová, the incident will not hinder the safe operation of the distribution station. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The damage is estimated at several tens of millions of crowns, although the exact figure will not be known until the fire has been extinguished. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Mandátová says that the ruined transformer will have to be replaced with a new one. </seg>
<seg id="9"> She added that nothing like this had ever happened in the ten years that Čeps has been operating, and this kind of fault was a one-off. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> According to ČEZ spokeswoman for northern Bohemia, Sonia Holingerová Hendrychová, there were no power cuts and households, offices and companies were not affected by the transformer fire. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The owner of Student Agency, Radim Jančura, will today file a slander suit against three social democrat commissioners. </seg>
<seg id="3"> These are Michal Hašek, commissioner for South Moravia, Radko Martínek, commissioner for Pardubice, and Olomouc commissioner Martin Tesařík. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Jančura announced this in the Twenty Minutes programme on Radiožurnál. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The suit relates to the company&apos;s attempts to operate regional trains in certain regions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, all the regions eventually signed a long-term contract with Czech Railways. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> So now all three commissioners are attacking us and saying that we&apos;re getting the best out of it, while the offer we put forward was just what they themselves wanted. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They claim that we&apos;re more expensive than Czech Railways, which is not true, as we know the Czech Railways prices that were concluded last week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> So all we can do is defend ourselves. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It&apos;s for slander against Student Agency, Jančura told Radiožurnál. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> He also said that he has proof from all the regional authorities that they did not act in accordance with European law. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He is therefore preparing a motion for the European Commission. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Hašek sees the suit as a further continuation of Mr Jančura&apos;s great media show, which works as a free advertisement for himself and his company. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It&apos;s understandable that I&apos;m prepared to defend my good name and that of my region, and I call upon the other commissioners to do the same. </seg>
<seg id="15"> I expect that this matter will clearly show that it is Mr Jančura who is manipulating the public over regional rail transport and using lies and false arguments, said Hašek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Last week, Jančura said that he is investing several million crowns in advertising to draw attention to these inappropriate actions taken by the regional authorities. </seg>
<seg id="17"> He told Radiožurnál that he was halting the campaign for Christmas and would restart it in the New Year. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He specified that the campaign would fight corruption as such. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Jančura started the campaign after the regions decided to operate regional rail links with Czech Railways and had not announced tenders for the order, worth around 150 billion crowns. </seg>
<seg id="20"> According to Jančura this is illegal and in contravention of the principles of the European Court of Justice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Jančura claims that his criticism of regional rail transport has already led to his being threatened by a member of the ČSSD. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The only threat was that if we don&apos;t stop this, we could lose our bus licence. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He introduced himself as a member of the ČSSD, I know who it was but I&apos;m not going to say his name, Jančura told Radiožurnál today. </seg>

<seg id="4"> But some are saying that compulsory vaccinations would be more effective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Preparations for the introduction of free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are reaching a peak. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The pharmaceutical institute is already setting the maximum price for vaccines to be paid for by health insurance companies. </seg>

<seg id="10"> Starting January, there could be free anti-pneumococcus vaccinations for children born on or after August 2nd. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The condition is that they have not received any prior vaccinations. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Anyone who began to be vaccinated last year or earlier will have to pay for any later re-vaccinations. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The first batch of vaccinations must be given when the child is between 3 and 5 months old. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Last year, one in four families had their children voluntarily vaccinated against pneumococcus. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Parents paid 1600 crowns or more per vaccination. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The youngest children require four vaccinations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Overall, experts estimate that health insurance companies spend 300 to 450 thousand crowns a year on vaccinations. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But they save on the treatment that unvaccinated children would otherwise need. </seg>
<seg id="19"> So far, the state has been paying around 500 thousand crowns a year on all general vaccinations for children. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Subsidised vaccinations were introduced as part of the Janota package. </seg>

<seg id="25"> Some believe that in the future these vaccinations could be compulsory. </seg>
<seg id="26"> As of January, they should be paid for by the insurance companies and not compulsory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The head of the Nahlas civil association, Rudolf Kalovský, says that compulsory vaccinations would be better. </seg>
<seg id="28"> His association has long been promoting pneumococcus vaccines. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The specialists at the international conference that our association attended were not very happy to hear that we have voluntary vaccinations. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It&apos;s not completely ideal. </seg>
<seg id="31"> On the other hand, we&apos;re happy that we managed to get at least these voluntary vaccinations in place. </seg>
<seg id="32"> I think this is the route we have to take, said Kalovský. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The Ministry of Health, however, does not want to change the pneumococcus vaccination system. </seg>
<seg id="34"> We&apos;re not considering it at this time, said ministry spokesman Vlastimil Sršeň. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks, say doctors </seg>
<seg id="36"> The chairwoman of the Professional Society of Paediatricians, Hana Cabrnochová, acknowledges that voluntary vaccinations have their drawbacks. </seg>
<seg id="37"> If all children were vaccinated, the number of revaccinations could then be cut. &quot;With vaccines costing so much, we can understand the political decision that vaccinations should be offered on a voluntary basis,&quot; says Cabrnochová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Experts assume that, starting next year, more than 80 percent of new parents will have their babies vaccinated against pneumococcus. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The anti-pneumococcus vaccinations are a milestone in that they are the first general vaccinations for children to be paid for by the insurance companies, not the state. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Insurance companies should fund prevention to save money on later treatment, explains Cabrnochová. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Doctors will have to buy vaccines themselves </seg>
<seg id="42"> However, practising paediatricians are concerned when it comes to buying the vaccines. </seg>
<seg id="43"> According to the original plan, the vaccines would be purchased by the insurance companies, and doctors would receive them in the same way that the state issues drugs for other vaccinations. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Some ministers, however, are worried that the insurance companies could &quot;run wild with health insurance funds&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="45"> So doctors will have to buy the vaccines and wait until the insurance companies refund the money. </seg>
<seg id="46"> It is estimated that practising paediatricians will have to spend 40 thousand a month on vaccines, which is a lot of money. </seg>
<seg id="47"> It certainly won&apos;t be easy, says Cabrnochová. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Can Islam Be French? </seg>
<seg id="3"> Pluralism and Pragmatism in a Secularist State. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> AT A time when Swiss voters have called for a ban on the construction of minarets and there is widespread alarm over the supposed Islamisation of Europe, John Bowen, an American academic, has written an informed and measured account of whether Muslims can integrate—and are integrating—into one of the continent’s most avowedly secular societies. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Some readers will come to this new book as admirers of the author’s last work, &quot;Why the French Don’t Like Headscarves&quot; (2006), an elegant and closely argued study of an issue that divided and preoccupied the country for a decade and a half, and whose effects are still felt today. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Mr Bowen’s latest book has a broader and more ambitious canvas. </seg>
<seg id="7"> As a good anthropologist, he wants to know not just what the politicians and the media are saying about Islam in France, but what is actually happening on the ground. </seg>
<seg id="8"> He has spent months in the mosques, schools and institutes which now provide France’s 5m-6m Muslims with what Mr Bowen calls &quot;Islamic spaces&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He is a good listener, reproducing debates between teachers and students about the questions that concern them most. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Should a Muslim get married in a mosque or a town hall (or both)? </seg>
<seg id="11"> Should young Muslims be taught about evolution and gay rights? </seg>
<seg id="12"> Can a Muslim woman marry a non-Muslim man? </seg>
<seg id="13"> Is it legitimate for a Muslim to use an interest-based banking system to get a mortgage? </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is these seemingly mundane issues, he argues, that are the stuff of daily life rather than the political dramas that preoccupy the media. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, none of them household names, with the possible exception of Tariq Ramadan, a Swiss-born Arab Muslim scholar and academic. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This new generation is trying to open up the debate about how to be both a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They are not having the argument all their way. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Conservatives are suspicious of the very idea of a French or European Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The thinkers and activists whom Mr Bowen interviews tend to be at odds with their Salafi counterparts—advocates of the purist Sunni Islam associated with Saudi Arabia—who nowadays have a small but influential presence among Europe’s Muslims. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Mr Bowen thinks that Muslim values and French secularism could be compatible. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But accommodation requires give-and-take on both sides. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He questions how far French policymakers (and the intellectual elite that so fiercely guards laïcité) are really committed to pluralism. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He suggests that Muslims are probably getting a rawer deal than the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who have also had to make their historic compromises with secular republicanism. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Rather than a growing pragmatism, he detects a &quot;tightening of the value-screws&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Can Islam be French? After reading this book, one is inclined to say, &quot;Yes, but not yet.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="13"> Although banned in Norway, America and Russia, the killing continues in Greenland and Canada, where hunters in helicopters and skidoo-riding Inuit Indians both use high-powered assault rifles to bring down their quarry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Ironically it is in the waters towards the north of those two hunting nations that the ice will last longest. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In his new book, &quot;After the Ice&quot;, Alun Anderson, a former editor of New Scientist, offers a clear and chilling account of the science of the Arctic and a gripping glimpse of how the future may turn out there. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> Not that scientists have all the answers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Neither atmospheric scientists nor oceanographers can adequately account for the speed of the changes. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It is not for want of trying. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Fridtjof Nansen’s pioneering journeys at the end of the 19th century and early 20th century first hinted at the whirling of the ice pack. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Cold-war submarines then mapped the shifting ridges running beneath it. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Satellite surveys and large arrays of iceberg-mounted probes are a useful addition, but much is still done by hardy individuals camped out in the cold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Mr Anderson looks in on the extraordinary, tiny world of the tributary system within the Arctic ice, formed by trickles of briny water which gets squeezed as it freezes. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> Pfc. De&apos;Angello Robinson, 19, traveled seven hours by bus to place a single wreath on the tomb of a soldier whom he&apos;d never met. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> He was one of more than 6,000 volunteers who gathered Saturday morning to place wreaths on veterans&apos; gravesites across several sections of Arlington Ceremony. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In 1992, Morrill Worcester, owner of Worcester Wreath Company in Harrington, Maine, began the event when he and several others decided to decorate several hundred gravesites at Arlington Ceremony. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Now an 18-year-old tradition, Morrill and his wife Karen, make the trip every year stopping in different cities along the way to host events dedicated to the people in the military and victims of terrorism. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Worcesters also founded a non-profit, Wreaths Across America, which has spread the event across other states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This year, volunteers placed more than 16,000 wreaths on the graves at Arlington Cemetery, areas at the Pentagon, graves at Fayetteville National Cemetery in Arkansas, Battery Park in New York City and on the memorial site for United Airlines Flight 93 in Shanksville, Pa. </seg>
<seg id="12"> For the second year, the Walmart Foundation donated more than $150,000 to purchase, and transport the wreaths. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> Wrapped in layers of warm clothing, volunteers walked across the cemetery&apos;s expansive lawns and hills. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Volunteers targeted older tombs from World War I, World War II, and the war in Vietnam because they are not visited as often as newer graves, organizers said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The mood was upbeat as children played and couples held hands while carrying the fresh pine to the graying tombstones. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Cuban government has arrested a U.S. government contractor who was distributing cellphones and laptop computers in the country, State Department officials said Saturday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The contractor, who has not yet been identified, works for Development Alternatives Inc., based in Bethesda. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The company works on projects for clients such as the U.S. Agency for International Development and the World Bank. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Consular officers with the U.S. Interest Section in Havana are seeking access to the detainee, who was arrested Dec. 5. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The specific charges have not been made public, though under Cuban law, a Cuban citizen or a foreign visitor can be arrested for nearly anything under the claim of &quot;dangerousness.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> All so-called counter-revolutionary activities, which include mild protests and critical writings, carry the risk of arrest. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Anti-government graffiti and speech are considered serious crimes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Cuba has a fledging blogging community, led by the popular commentator Yoani Sánchez, who often writes about how she and her husband are followed and harassed by government agents. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Sánchez has repeatedly applied for permission to leave the country to accept awards but has been denied permission. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The detention of an American contractor may likely raise tensions between the Castro brothers Communist government in Cuba and the Obama administration, which has been pursuing a &quot;go-slow&quot; approach to improving relations with the island. </seg>
<seg id="12"> News of the arrest was first reported by the New York Times Friday night. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The new U.S. policy stresses that if the Cuban government takes concrete steps, such as freeing political prisoners and creating more space for opposition, the United States will reciprocate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Cellphones and laptops are legal in Cuba, though they are new and coveted commodities in a country where the average wage of a government worker is $15 a month. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The Cuban government granted ordinary citizens the right to buy cellphones just this year; they are used mostly for texting, as a 15-minute telephone conversation would eat up a day&apos;s wages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Internet use is extremely limited on the island. </seg>
<seg id="17"> It is available in expensive hotels and to foreign visitors there, and at some government outlets, such as universities. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Cubans who want to log on often have to give their names to the government. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Access to many Web sites is restricted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The detention of an American in Cuba is rare. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Most of the handful of U.S. citizens in jail in Cuba are behind bars for crimes such as drug smuggling, said Gloria Berbena, the press officer at the U.S. Interests Section in Havana. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Berbena said she could not provide more information on the arrest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The arrest and detention are clearly wrong. </seg>
<seg id="24"> An activity that in any other open society would be legal -- giving away free cellphones -- is in Cuba a crime, said Jose Miguel Vivanco, director of the Americas program of the group Human Rights Watch, which recently issued a tough report on freedoms in Cuba called &quot;New Castro, Same Cuba,&quot; a reference to the installation of Raul Castro as the leader of the country to replace his ailing older brother Fidel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Vivanco said that the accused are often arrested, tried and imprisoned in a day. </seg>
<seg id="26"> He said that any solution would likely be political and that the Cuban government often provokes a negative reaction in the United States just as the two countries begin to move toward more dialogue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Pakistani officials unraveling plot to send men to Afghanistan </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Pakistani authorities on Saturday zeroed in on the alleged mastermind of a plot to send five Northern Virginia men to Afghanistan to kill U.S. troops, saying they hope the case could help unravel an extensive network of terrorist recruiters who scour the Internet for radicalized young men. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Investigators said they were hunting for a shadowy insurgent figure known as Saifullah, who invited the men to Pakistan after first discovering them when one made comments approving of terror attacks on the Internet video site YouTube. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Saifullah guided the men once they were in Pakistan, attempting to help them reach the remote area in Pakistan&apos;s tribal belt that is home to al-Qaeda and its terrorist training camps. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But a Pakistani intelligence official who had been briefed on the case said Saturday that Saifullah was unsuccessful in convincing al-Qaeda commanders that the men were not part of a CIA plot to infiltrate the terrorist network. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As a result, they were marooned for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far from the forbidding mountains of the northwest that have become a terrorist haven. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> They were regarded as a sting operation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That&apos;s why they were rejected, said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the case. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The official said the men were undeterred and were still trying to acquire the right endorsements to gain access to the al-Qaeda camps when they were arrested by Pakistani law enforcement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The case of the five -- who remain in Pakistan and are being questioned by the FBI -- underscores the critical role of recruiters in identifying potential terrorists and, perhaps more importantly, determining who can be trusted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, U.S. intelligence has made it a top priority to try to place human assets inside al-Qaeda. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The organization&apos;s recruiters act as gatekeepers, keeping out those who are not serious about their commitment to holy war, and those who could be spies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Would-be American recruits are treated by al-Qaeda with special scrutiny, analysts said. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But they are also considered enormously appealing to the group because of their potential to access U.S. targets and because of their propaganda value. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> But Evan Kohlmann, senior analyst with the U.S.-based NEFA Foundation, said terror groups have also become much more cautious in recent years about who they allow in because U.S. intelligence agencies have become experts in their recruiting methods. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> If you&apos;re trying to sink someone into these groups, what better way than to follow the recruitment model that so many have already followed? Kohlmann said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The model is one that has become far more Web-based. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Tens of thousands of protesters marched on the streets here Saturday, demanding bolder action on climate from the negotiators working inside the city&apos;s Bella Convention Center. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Protesters said as many 100,000 people joined in the event, but police estimated the count was closer to 25,000. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The event was relatively peaceful, though a handful of masked activists set off small explosives near a group of government buildings downtown. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On a day when little happened in the U.N.-sponsored climate talks, thousands of activists walked across the city holding banners in English saying &quot;There is No Planet B&quot; and one in Spanish declaring, &quot;The Earth is Saying, &apos;Enough.&apos; </seg>
<seg id="6"> Several celebrities joined the protest, including Danish model and photographer Helena Christensen, who said that traveling to her mother&apos;s native country of Peru made me aware of the heartbreaking issues the country is dealing with due to the impacts of climate changes that are already occurring.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> This is part of the reason why I have decided to join the big march -- to pass on the word and to appeal to the world&apos;s leaders to deliver a fair, ambitious and binding deal, she said. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is not an easy task, but it needs to be done, there is no way around it anymore. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The police kept the protesters from getting too close to the Bella center, and said they had arrested 19 people, primarily on the grounds that they had either worn masks or carried pocket knives. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Those activities are banned during demonstrations under Danish law. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> According to one bystander, who asked not to be identified because he is involved in the climate talks, activists sporting masks and black outfits set off several explosives near Copenhagen&apos;s main canal, which is nearby several ministries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> They were lobbing them by the buildings, he said, adding they began as flares but were followed by &quot;a couple big explosions.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Inside the convention center, people gathered around television screens to watch the march throughout the afternoon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> But the protest did not seem to penetrate the consciousness of key officials such as Su Wei, China&apos;s chief climate negotiator. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When asked whether he thought the demonstration was having a constructive impact on the international deliberations, he replied in English, &quot;Actually, that is something that I was not aware of.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> He then continued in Mandarin, saying, &quot;Because the venue is large, I cannot hear what is happening outside.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="17"> He observed that whether the march was hurting or helping depended on one&apos;s perspective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> It shows the concentration of the general public and different sectors on the subject of climate change, he said. </seg>
<seg id="19"> On the other hand, &quot;You can also say that they disrupt the negotiations, or the freedom of other people. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Test data reveal stubborn racial gaps </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Last week&apos;s federal report card on math achievement was a welcome piece of good news for D.C. public schools. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Although the District still lags far behind the country&apos;s top-performing systems, the report card showed fourth- and eighth-graders making strides at a faster pace over the past two years than cities including Atlanta, Chicago and New York. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But what remains embedded in the latest numbers from the National Assessment of Educational Progress is the persistent achievement gap between African American and white students both locally and nationally. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The average scores of white D.C. fourth-graders over the past two years grew from 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but their African American peers&apos; rose just three points, from 209 to 212. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The achievement gap actually grew between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> African American progress in the eighth grade remained essentially flat, dipping a statistically insignificant one point, from 245 to 244. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Average white scores were not included in the test results because the sample size wasn&apos;t large enough. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The picture across a six-year stretch isn&apos;t more encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The gap separating white and black fourth-graders in 2003, when the first NAEP in the District was given, was 60 scale points (262 to 202). </seg>
<seg id="11"> Although the scores achieved by children in both groups have increased during this period, the difference has barely narrowed to 58. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Some education advocates in the District expressed concern last week that the gains celebrated by Chancellor Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (D) were propelled largely by white students who are already high achievers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> It would suggest that we&apos;ve raised the aggregate by treating those at the higher end of the scale, which is problematic and troublesome, said Jeff Smith, executive director of D.C. Voice, a nonprofit group that advocates for educational equality in the District. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> I&apos;m not jumping up and down about a two- or three-point spread, said D.C. Council member Kwame R. Brown (D-At Large), who has a daughter in the fourth grade at Eaton Elementary. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A frequent critic of Rhee&apos;s management style, Brown said the message of the test scores is that the city&apos;s middle schools are in desperate need of attention. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Clearly, you always want to see the plus signs, and I respect that. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But what&apos;s scary is we&apos;re not spending nearly the time and energy we need to spend on our middle schools. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Rhee said the District needs to continue to find better ways to address the needs of low-achieving students. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This fall, for example, some teachers are being trained to use a new reading curriculum, the Wilson Reading System, targeted to students in the upper elementary and middle school grades who didn&apos;t master the basics of reading early in their school careers and are significantly behind their peers. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Everyday Mathematics, a K-through-sixth-grade math curriculum emphasizing games and real-life experiences that was brought to the District under former superintendent Clifford Janey, is credited with some of the NAEP progress reported last week. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="21"> I just think we have to keep working at bringing the best interventions to those students who are below grade level, Rhee said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Others say that the NAEP&apos;s results highlight the question of whether Rhee can continue to lift the overall performance of the system and still provide the additional money and resources for low-performing schools that will be necessary to narrow the gap. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> There is a sort of rough-edged dilemma here for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, an education professor at the University of California at Berkeley who studies urban test scores. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The conventional policy remedy is to target your resources and management reforms on schools located in the poorest sections of D.C. </seg>
<seg id="25"> So the targeting may yield political repercussions that go against that important agenda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But the rub, of course, is like other urban superintendents, she&apos;s trying to hold on to the white and black middle class. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Our focus is on ensuring that we build a system of great schools. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We need to strengthen our neighborhood schools so that all families, regardless of where they live, are confident that their children can get an excellent public education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Janey, now superintendent of schools in Newark, said in an interview this week that one essential element to closing the achievement gap is to lengthen the traditional public school year, currently 180 days in the District, to compete with charter schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> You have to get up near 200 days to have the force of change, said Janey, who came to agreement with his teachers&apos; union last year on a 185-day year, which he regards as &quot;a marker&quot; for seeking a bigger increase in the next contract. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The tour bus pulled into Gettysburg College with a loud wheeze. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Graciela Rodriguez, 12, stepped off and blinked for a moment at the white columns, brick facades and emerald lawns. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Graciela&apos;s parents had barely graduated from high school in El Salvador. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Until recently, Graciela herself, who was born in Silver Spring and lives in Riverdale, had never set foot on a college campus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yet as she and the other eighth-graders in the group explored Gettysburg, where the tuition runs $38,690 a year, their attitude was less that of awestruck visitors than of enthusiastic prospective students. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Yes! This is where I&apos;ll be! exclaimed Graciela, who would like to study medicine, when the guide announced that they&apos;d entered the science building. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Wow, really? she said thoughtfully, when told of the school&apos;s low professor-to-student ratio. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Pennsylvania college was the seventh the kids had visited on their three-day tour, and by now they had completely absorbed its intended message: The question is not whether you&apos;re going to college. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The question is where. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Although there is mounting concern about the large number U.S.-born children of Hispanic immigrants who drop out of high school or get pregnant as teenagers, there are also hundreds of thousands who are getting the college educations they need to enter the middle class. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, one in five of these &quot;second-generation&quot; Hispanics graduates from college -- a notable achievement given that so many of their immigrant parents, mostly Mexicans and Central Americans, entered the United States without finishing high school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Their success stories are important, researchers say, because they point the way forward for a generation that will play an outsize role in the country&apos;s workforce. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Those who study high achievers say they often have a natural affinity for school and an innate drive to succeed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Many also have parents who set lofty goals for their children and find ways to compensate for their unfamiliarity with American schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> But mentoring programs also can play an enormous role in helping Graciela and millions of children like her make it to college -- particularly if those efforts are sustained over time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> When you&apos;re looking at low-income kids whose parents don&apos;t have the experience and the skills to help them navigate through the system, any single intervention at any one point in time is not going to solve it, said Patricia Gándara, a researcher at the University of California, Davis, who has studied Latino students. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We need to think about providing a supportive network for these kids from preschool all the way on through high school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The federal program that funded Graciela&apos;s college tour is a useful example. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Known as GEAR UP, it provides more than $300 million a year to local school systems to run college prep programs that begin when low-income students are in middle school and continue until they finish high school. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Since 1999, the program has served more than 10 million students, with more than 60 percent going on to college, according to the U.S. Department of Education. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Despite concerns about violence and political instability, the Iraqi government managed to attract major oil companies to rebuild its ailing infrastructure during two auctions that concluded Saturday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The 10 deals the Iraqi Oil Ministry reached with foreign oil companies suggest that China, Russia and European oil firms are poised to play a major role in refurbishing Iraq&apos;s oil industry, crippled by decades of war and sanctions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> American companies walked away with stakes in just two of the 10 auctioned fields. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Seven American companies had paid to participate in the second auction, which began Friday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The only one that submitted a bid lost. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Two American companies reached deals for fields auctioned in June. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The meager representation of American oil giants in Iraq&apos;s opening oil industry surprised analysts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Iraq finally opened its doors after six years of war, and instead of U.S. companies, you have Asians and Europeans leading the way, said Ruba Husari, the editor of Iraq Oil Forum, an online news outlet. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It will be a long time before anything else will be on offer in Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Concerns over security, underscored by massive coordinated bombings Tuesday, and political instability as the U.S. military withdraws, likely kept American oil companies from venturing more forcefully in Iraq, which has the world&apos;s third-largest proven crude reserves, analysts said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> U.S. firms were in some cases at a disadvantage because rivals, particularly the Chinese and other government controlled energy firms, have markedly lower labor costs and are more prone to take risks because they don&apos;t respond to shareholders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Exxon-Mobil and Occidental Petroleum Inc. were the only American companies that reached deals with the ministry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Major U.S. firms such as Chevron and ConocoPhillips, which have cultivated close ties with the Iraqi Oil Ministry and have provided technical advice in recent years, walked away empty-handed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Russian companies Lukoil and Gazprom were the top stakeholders in two of the contracts awarded this weekend. </seg>
<seg id="16"> State-owned Chinese National Petroleum Corp. bid on more contracts than any other company and walked away with large stakes in contracts for two major fields. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> We all know that China is on track to become a major economic as well as technological power, Oil Ministry spokesman Assam Jihad said. </seg>
<seg id="18"> We feel confident that the Chinese company will be on par with its competitors and will deliver on its commitments towards Iraq. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Companies pre-selected to submit bids made offers that were then compared to the per barrel fee the ministry was willing to pay for boosting output above current levels at each field. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Top al-Qaeda planner apparently killed in Pakistan </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> An apparent U.S. missile strike along Pakistan&apos;s border with Afghanistan is believed to have killed a top al-Qaeda operations planner this week, U.S. counterterrorism officials said Friday. </seg>
<seg id="3"> If confirmed, this would be the second deadly attack against a senior terrorist leader this fall. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Saleh al-Somali was one of two Arab men thought to have been killed when a pair of missiles tore into their car Tuesday near the town of Miran Shah in North Waziristan province, according to U.S. sources and Pakistani officials in the region. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Local authorities said the missiles were fired by an unmanned aircraft of the type operated by the CIA inside Pakistan&apos;s lawless tribal belt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> They were driving in a white car, heading toward the Afghan border, when the car was hit, said an official with Pakistan&apos;s civilian intelligence agency, speaking by phone from Miran Shah. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The official said suspected local militants rushed to the spot and quickly confiscated what remained of the &quot;totally demolished bodies.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Local authorities were unable to verify the victims&apos; identities, but two U.S. counterterrorism officials cited unspecified evidence that Somali was among the dead. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Somali was described as a senior al-Qaeda military planner who ran the terrorist group&apos;s operations outside the Afghanistan-Pakistan region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> He was engaged in plotting throughout the world, said one senior official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, citing the sensitive nature of U.S. airstrikes inside Pakistani territory. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Given his central role, this probably included plotting attacks against the United States and Europe. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He took strategic guidance from al-Qaeda&apos;s top leadership and translated it into operational blueprints for prospective terrorist attacks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The second U.S. official said Somali had risen quickly through al-Qaeda&apos;s ranks and was well-connected with other extremist groups in the region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He may not be a household name to some Americans, but that in no way diminishes the threat he posed to us and our allies, the second official said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> If his death is confirmed, Somali would be the second senior al-Qaeda or Taliban leader killed since September, when a similar strike killed Najmuddin Jalolov, the leader of a militant faction in the tribal belt, and three other top operatives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The tempo of strikes by CIA-run drones has declined since the summer, from an average of about six operations per month to two, according to a tally by the Long War Journal, a Web site managed by a nonprofit group. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The decline may be due to improved tactics by terrorist groups, which have taken steps to limit their vulnerability while also ruthlessly killing suspected informants, the site said. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Top U.N. envoy in Kabul to step down </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The United Nations&apos; top envoy in Afghanistan, Kai Eide, said Friday that he would step down from his post in March, ending a tumultuous tenure that was marred by allegations of widespread corruption in Afghanistan&apos;s U.N.-backed presidential election. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Eide&apos;s departure comes as the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 U.S. troops to Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The U.N. envoy said that he supports the surge but expressed concern that the U.S. timetable for a military drawdown beginning in 18 months would prompt other NATO governments to withdraw their forces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> We need to accelerate the buildup of the Afghan security forces and send the right signal to the Afghans that they can trust the international community, Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The commitment has to be long-term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Norwegian diplomat also pressed the United States and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants aiding Afghanistan&apos;s political transition. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The surge on the military side has to be copied on the civilian side, he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Eide said he was not resigning but simply fulfilling a commitment he made to his family in March 2008 to spend only two years in Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He said he wanted to serve notice to U.N. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Secretary General Ban Ki-moon now so that he would have time to find a replacement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> What I&apos;ve said is that you better start looking for a successor, Eide said. </seg>
<seg id="13"> When I came here, there was a two-month vacuum between a departure of my predecessor and my arrival. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Ban has begun searching for a replacement, according to U.N. officials. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The officials say he has been considering Staffan di Mistura, a Swedish-Italian national who recently headed the U.N. mission in Baghdad, and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who previously led U.N. peacekeeping operations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Eide&apos;s standing in Afghanistan was tested after his former deputy, Peter W. Galbraith, accused him in September of favoring President Hamid Karzai in the country&apos;s presidential vote and of covering up evidence of massive electoral fraud. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Eide denied the allegations, but he said the accusations by Galbraith -- who was fired -- &quot;certainly damaged the mission, because there was already a great degree of skepticism with regard to international interference&quot; in the election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Eide said he proposed the appointment of a senior civilian representative to coordinate relief efforts by the U.S.-led forces in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He also urged the U.N. leadership to allow his successor to hire more staff from the United States and other Western countries that donate to the Afghan mission, saying it would increase their confidence that their money is being properly spent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Eide expressed frustration with the limitations on his powers in Afghanistan, saying that cumbersome U.N. hiring regulations undercut his ability to bring in talent. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The U.N. rules are such that I have only been able to recruit a single person since May, he said. </seg>
<seg id="22"> That is catastrophic and can&apos;t continue. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Gates: Iran to face additional sanctions </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Defense Secretary Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers will soon impose &quot;significant additional sanctions&quot; on Iran over its failure to engage in talks on its nuclear ambitions. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Gates, speaking to a group of about 300 U.S. troops in northern Iraq during a week-long tour of war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, played down the prospect of military action against the Islamic republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> There are no good options in Iran, he said, in response to a query from a soldier about the likelihood of such a development. ¨ </seg>
<seg id="5"> One of the things that weighs on me is that if we have learned anything from Iraq over the past six years, [it] is the inherent unpredictability of war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Obama administration is considering a package of sanctions that would target Iran&apos;s military and political elite, but Gates signaled that some of the sanctions could also affect ordinary Iranians. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He said that &quot;a package of incentives and disincentives&quot; would be needed &quot;to persuade the Iranian government that they would actually be less secure with nuclear weapons&quot; because &quot;their people will suffer enormously&quot; from sanctions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In a statement Friday by White House spokesman Robert Gibbs, the administration joined European leaders in warning that Iran will face &quot;credible&quot; consequences if it does not bring its nuclear program into full compliance with the U.N. Security Council and its nuclear watchdog, the International Atomic Energy Agency. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Iran insists that it wants to develop nuclear expertise only for peaceful purposes. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In talks in Geneva on Oct. 1, it indicated that it would return to talks on restraining its nuclear program and agree to give up a substantial portion of its stockpile of enriched uranium in exchange for desperately needed fuel for a medical research reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The administration has pushed for such an agreement as a way to build confidence between the two sides and to buy time for negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But since then, Iran appears to have walked away from the tentative deals -- in part, experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided over whether to engage with the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Frankly, Iran&apos;s stiffing the international community on some of the proposals that they actually agreed to at the beginning of October, I think, has brought the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, together in a way that they have not been in terms of significant additional sanctions on the Iranians, Gates said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> President Obama has set a Dec. 31 deadline for Iran to respond to the proposals before he turns to reviewing other options, including pursuing what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called &quot;crippling sanctions.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In a statement issued in New York, Iran&apos;s mission to the United Nations denounced what it called &quot;baseless and unfounded allegations&quot; Thursday by some Security Council members about Iran&apos;s nuclear activities and said it is willing to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers &quot;in order to achieve an appropriate, long-term solution.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Gates, who was to return to Washington late Friday, met in the morning with Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al-Maliki before flying to Iraq&apos;s oil-rich Kurdish region for meetings with troops in Kirkuk and Kurdish officials in Irbil. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Tensions remain high between the Kurds and Iraq&apos;s Arab majority, particularly over boundaries, property rights and revenue-sharing. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Gates urged both sides to reduce the potential for conflict to prevent any delays in U.S. plans to cut the number of American troops from 115,000 to 50,000 by the end of August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Gates also sought to allay Kurdish anxiety about the pending drawdown. U.S. officials quoted Gates as telling Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: &quot;We will preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We will not abandon you.&quot; </seg>

<seg id="1"> In aging China, a change of course </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by propaganda posters lecturing them that &quot;Mother Earth is too tired to sustain more children&quot; and &quot;One more baby means one more tomb.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="3"> They learned the lesson so well that when Shanghai government officials, alarmed by their city&apos;s low birthrate and aging population, abruptly changed course this summer and began encouraging young couples to have more than one child, their reaction was instant and firm: No way. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> We have already given all our time and energy for just one child. </seg>
<seg id="5"> We have none left for a second, said Wang, 31, a human resources administrator with an 8-month-old son. </seg>
<seg id="6"> More than 30 years after China&apos;s one-child policy was introduced, creating two generations of notoriously chubby, spoiled only children affectionately nicknamed &quot;little emperors,&quot; a population crisis is looming in the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The average birthrate has plummeted to 1.8 children per couple as compared with six when the policy went into effect, according to the U.N. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Population Division, while the number of residents 60 and older is predicted to explode from 16.7 percent of the population in 2020 to 31.1 percent by 2050. That is far above the global average of about 20 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The imbalance is worse in wealthy coastal cities with highly educated populations, such as Shanghai. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Last year, people 60 and older accounted for almost 22 percent of Shanghai&apos;s registered residents, while the birthrate was less than one child per couple. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission, has said that fertile couples need to have babies to &quot;help reduce the proportion of the aging population and alleviate a workforce shortage in the future.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="12"> Shanghai is about to be &quot;as old -- not as rich, though -- as developed countries such as Japan and Sweden,&quot; she said. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A gradual easing </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Written into the country&apos;s constitution in 1978, China&apos;s one-child policy is arguably the most controversial mandate introduced by the ruling Communist Party to date. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Couples who violate the policy face enormous fines -- up to three times their annual salary in some areas -- and discrimination at work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Chinese officials have credited the policy with helping the country avoid critical strain on its natural resources, while human rights advocates have denounced abuses in the enforcement of the policy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In rural areas, some officials have forced women pregnant with a second child to undergo abortions. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, many couples have had sex-selective abortions, leading to an unnaturally high male-to-female ratio. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In recent years, population officials have gradually softened their stance on the one-child policy. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 2004, they allowed for more exceptions to the rule -- including urban residents, members of ethnic minorities and cases in which both husband and wife are only children -- and in 2007, they toned down many of their hard-line slogans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Qiao Xiaochun, a professor at the Institute of Population Research at Peking University, said central government officials have recently been debating even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one partner is an only child. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage more births. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Almost overnight, posters directing families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations detailing who would be eligible to have a second child and how to apply for a permit. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The city government dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet with couples in their homes and slip leaflets under doors. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It has also pledged to provide emotional and financial counseling to those electing to have more than one child. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The response has been underwhelming, family planning officials say. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Disappointing response </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Although officials in one rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they saw an uptick in applications from couples wanting a second child after the campaign was launched, the more urban districts report no change. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Huinan township, with a population of 115,000, for instance, is still receiving just four to five applications a month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Disappointed Shanghai officials say that, despite the campaign, the number of births in the city in 2010 is still expected to be only about 165,000 -- slightly higher than in 2009 but lower than in 2008. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Feng Juying, head of the family planning committee in Shanghai&apos;s Caolu township, said financial considerations are probably the main reason many people don&apos;t want more children. </seg>
<seg id="32"> They want to give the best to their first, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Yang Jiawei, 27, and his wife, Liu Juanjuan, 26, said they would love to have two children and are legally allowed to do so. </seg>
<seg id="34"> But like many Chinese, they have only the scant medical and life insurance provided by the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Without a social safety net, they say, the choice would be irresponsible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> People in the West wrongly see the one-child policy as a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple&apos;s first child. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Yes, we are being robbed of the chance to have more than one child. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the problem is not just some policy. </seg>
<seg id="39"> It is money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Other couples cite psychological reasons for hesitating. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Wang, the human resources administrator, said she wants an only child because she was one herself: &quot;We were at the center of our families and used to everyone taking care of us. </seg>
<seg id="42"> We are not used to taking care of and don&apos;t really want to take care of others.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Chen Zijian, a 42-year-old who owns a translation company, put it more bluntly. </seg>
<seg id="44"> For the dual-career, middle-class parents who are bringing the birthrate down, he said, it&apos;s about being successful enough to be selfish. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Today&apos;s 20- and 30-somethings grew up seeing their parents struggle during the early days of China&apos;s experiment with capitalism and don&apos;t want that kind of life for themselves, he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> Even one child makes huge demands on parents&apos; time, he said. </seg>
<seg id="47"> A mother has to give up at least two years of her social life. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Then there are the space issues -- &quot;You have to remodel your apartment&quot; -- and the strategizing -- &quot;You have to have a résumé ready by the time the child is 9 months old for the best preschools.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Most of his friends are willing to deal with this once, Chen said, but not twice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Ours is the first generation with higher living standards, he said. </seg>
<seg id="51"> We do not want to make too many sacrifices. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Forged by a U.N. ad-hoc working group, the text is silent on how much money rich countries would give poor ones to cope with global warming over the short and long term. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And it provides a range of options for the key questions, including how developed and major emerging economies would cut their carbon output, and what would be the upper limit of global temperature rise that policymakers would be willing to tolerate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It gives a lot of flexibility to the process, said John Coequyt, senior Washington representative for the Sierra Club. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Michael Zammit Cutajar, who drafted the six-page document, boiled down a 180-page negotiation text to focus on what the U.N.&apos;s top climate official, Yvo de Boer, described as &quot;the big picture.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It shows the outlines for a possible deal, in which industrial nations would collectively cut their emissions by 2020 by 25 to 45 percent compared with 1990 levels, while major developing countries would reduce theirs during the same period by 15 to 30 percent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Together, the countries would cut emissions between 50 and 95 percent by 2050. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The European Union gave the talks a boost as well on Friday by pledging to provide $3.6 billion a year over the next three years to help poorer countries adapt to the impact of climate change -- from coping with flood and drought to avoiding deforestation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Still, Friday featured the same sort of verbal fireworks that have dominated the talks for the past week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> U.S. special climate envoy Todd Stern rejected language requiring binding cuts of greenhouse-gas emissions for industrialized countries compared with voluntary ones by major emerging economies if they were not funded by the developed world. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The move signaled that the Obama administration is taking a harder line with China than Bush administration officials did just two years ago. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The United States is not going to do a deal without the major developing countries stepping up and taking action, said Stern, who also complained that the text did not do enough to make sure the cuts could be verified by outside observers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Stern made his comments an hour after Chinese vice foreign minister He Yafei said America&apos;s top climate negotiator was either lacking &quot;common sense&quot; or being &quot;extremely irresponsible&quot; for saying earlier in the week that the United States would not help China financially to cope with global warming. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> With the future economic trajectory of the world&apos;s major powers at stake, fault lines have erupted both within the developing world and between the industrial world and emerging economies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The current battle is as much about saving individual economies as saving the planet, with China and the United States feuding over their respective obligations while poorer nations insist that the world&apos;s two dozen most influential countries are ignoring the scientific imperative to take bolder action. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Ricardo Ulate, a Costa Rican delegate, said it&apos;s not surprising that the major powers are fighting over who should bear the costs for curbing greenhouse gases, even as vulnerable countries have become more aggressive in seeking to hold the big emitters accountable for their actions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> This is clearly a game where a new economic hegemony is being developed, said Ulate, who also serves as the regional Mexico and Central America climate change adviser for Conservation International. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Some of the countries most vulnerable to the impact of climate change indicated they would continue to push for a legally binding treaty in Copenhagen, although most of the major participants say the talks will produce a political deal at best. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The Alliance of Small Island States, which has 43 members, produced a 24-page draft treaty proposal early Friday morning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> Artur Runge-Metzger, who heads international climate negotiations on behalf of the European Commission, said the push by small island nations has &quot;put political pressure on the entire political process,&quot; in part because they are now unified and demanding action from emerging economies such as China and India. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The talks took on new urgency as delegates focused on the fact that they must resolve most of the outstanding issues before the heads of government arrive to strike a deal. </seg>
<seg id="25"> High-level officials such as Indian environment minister Jairam Ramesh and the Chinese vice minister stepped off planes and raced through the Bella Center&apos;s halls to closed-door meetings and news conferences so they could stake out claims that will be arbitrated over the next week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The sheer sprawl of the gathering -- where 13,000 people move in and out of the convention center each day, guitar-playing activists put on nightly shows mocking the countries they think are selling out, and draft proposals are passed hand-to-hand on paper rather than via e-mail -- poses a challenge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The intensity is only building: nearly all of the key ministers are now here, and as early as Wednesday 60 heads of government will be in Copenhagen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> We&apos;re getting into the big leagues, said Carlos Manuel Rodriguez, vice president for global policy at Conservation International. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The heavyweights are coming. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Britain’s first 140mph train to redefine that Monday feeling </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> At 5.13 on Monday morning a whistle will pierce the darkness to signal a train departure that marks a revolution for travel in Britain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The first high-speed commuter train in the country will reach 140mph as it streaks from Ashford, Kent, to London St Pancras, covering the 58 miles in 38 minutes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Lord Adonis, the Transport Secretary, will then be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes aboard the first Javelin commuter service out of London. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He hopes that the new service will eventually plug Britain into an international network of fast, reliable trains and connect the great conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Neglected backwaters would become thriving commuter towns, business travel times would be slashed and the shift from aircraft and cars to the railway would reduce national carbon emissions as well as easing congestion on the roads. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In theory, the three main political parties buy into this vision. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the tens of billions of pounds needed to build a new national rail network, the inevitable planning battle and fears of environmental harm may yet put the brakes on Britain’s high-speed lines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> High Speed Two (HS2), a company created in January to provide the Government with a feasibility study, will hand its report to Lord Adonis on December 30, The Times has learnt. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It will provide him with a detailed route map of the next planned stage of the high-speed network. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn to within five metres in urban areas and sites where the environmental impact may be contentious. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In open country, the plan will be drafted to within 25 metres of a final route. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> HS2 is also expected to set out three options for a wider high-speed network running north. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Lord Adonis will respond in the spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The favoured option being put forward is a Y-shaped configuration in which a single high-speed line would run up to the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The line would split at or near Birmingham, with one branch running west of the Pennines to Manchester and Scotland and another running northeast to Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A single line would run into Scotland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> &quot;It looks like it is going to be the best-performing option,&quot; a railway insider said. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Once complete, journey times between London and Edinburgh would be cut to 2 hours 40 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first leg, which would not open before 2025, would allow passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared with just over an hour at present. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The proposals would allow trains to travel at 250mph, making the British network the fastest in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The initial track is being designed to take trains 400m in length capable of carrying 1,100 people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> As many as 18 could operate each hour on a London-Birmingham line. </seg>
<seg id="24"> That means that a London terminal capable of handling 20,000 passengers an hour would be needed. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Given space constraints in the capital, it is expected that an existing station would be expanded to accommodate the high-speed network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer that potential. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he thinks the scheme should proceed, but lengthy public consultation and planning procedures mean that a final decision would not be made until after a general election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Even if he does put the wheels in motion, the network would have to be built in sections. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Trains would at first be forced to run off high-speed lines on to the existing rails north of Birmingham, keeping journey times between London and Scotland above three hours. </seg>
<seg id="30"> That is seen as the crucial tipping point needed to ensure a switch from planes to trains, a benchmark for the rail revolution. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Taxpayers meet mortgage on Tory&apos;s £75,000 orangery </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Alan Duncan, the frontbench Tory MP, charged the taxpayer thousands of pounds a year towards the cost of an orangery he built at his constituency home. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The party’s prisons spokesman, who was demoted by David Cameron for complaining that MPs were living &quot;on rations&quot;, increased his mortgage by £75,000 to build an oak-framed extension to his second home in Rutland. </seg>
<seg id="4"> He was allowed to charge the extra interest, totalling hundreds of pounds a month, to the taxpayer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Commons authorities approved the claims at the time and they have not been queried by Sir Thomas Legg, who is conducting a review of members’ expenses. Last night Mr Duncan said the claims &quot;couldn’t be cleaner or simpler&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Mr Duncan, one of the richest Members of Parliament, owns a two-storey house in a village in his Rutland and Melton constituency. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Houses near by have sold for almost a million pounds. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The ground floor comprises a kitchen, living room and dining room, but the fees office agreed that Mr Duncan needed more space. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Last year he added a conservatory to the house, described in plans as an &quot;orangery&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Neighbours described it as a &quot;glasshouse for entertaining&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Mr Duncan was not required to make any reference to the increased borrowing during a recent investigation by the Commons’ Standards and Privileges Committee into his previous mortgage arangements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The committee cleared him last month of breaching the rules after an investigation into his expenses. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In 2004 Mr Duncan changed the legal security for a £271,406 mortgage from his London property to his constituency home, which he had bought in 1991, the year before he became an MP. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Documents released this week show that Mr Duncan was claiming about £1,400 a month in mortgage interest until March last year. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In April, his claims increased to more than £1,800 a month. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The interest rate on Mr Duncan’s RBS mortgage did not change in that time, suggesting that all the increase was to fund the £75,000 borrowing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The RBS standard variable mortgage rate went down from 7.94 per cent in December 2007 to 4 per cent in March this year, where it remains. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The latest document release by the Commons authorities show that Mr Duncan was continuing to claim £1,250 a month this May. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Mr Duncan lost his job as Shadow Leader of the House in September after an undercover reporter filmed him saying that MPs had to survive &quot;on rations&quot; after the expenses scandal. </seg>
<seg id="20"> &quot;Basically, it’s being nationalised, you have to live on rations and are treated like s**t.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> He said: &quot;I spend my money on my garden and claim a tiny fraction based on what is proper. </seg>
<seg id="22"> And I could claim the whole bloody lot, but I don’t.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The MP, a millionaire from his former career as an oil trader, was first challenged over his expenses in May when it emerged that he had claimed thousands of pounds for his garden, before agreeing with the fees office that this &quot;could be considered excessive&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="24"> An activist dug a hole in the shape of a pound sign in Mr Duncan’s lawn in protest after it was revealed that he claimed £4,000 over three years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Asked about the increased mortgage last night, Mr Duncan said: &quot;It was for capital improvements approved both by the fees office and subsequently by Legg.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> He added: &quot;There is no issue of ducking and weaving or pushing the rules or anything. </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is absolutely straight down the line, within the rules, authorised and everything. </seg>
<seg id="28"> It just couldn’t in many ways be cleaner or simpler.&quot; </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Beach huts in Brighton have found a new lease of life for the winter months as an interactive Advent calendar. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Beyond, an alternative church group that encourages spiritual exploration through creativity, invited 24 owners to decorate their huts for each day in December, using Christmas carols as their theme. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The event started on December 1, with visitors allowed to view the latest hut from 5.30pm to 6.30pm each day, with mince pies and mulled wine laid on for free. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Carols chosen so far include I Saw Three Ships, O Come, O Come, Emmanuel and The First Noël, where the hut features the work of Janette Tozer, a local artist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Martin Poole, 50, a TV marketing assistant from Hove, is a non-stipendiary clergyman within the Chichester diocese and the leader of Beyond. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He said: &quot;We want to make religion more relevant to people in a post-Christendom society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> &quot;Why do we as a Church expect people to come to a strange old building? It’s my feeling the Church should come to the people and celebrate in exciting ways. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> &quot;The idea of the beach hut Advent calendar began just as a conversation with some friends over dinner. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Brighton is such a fantastically creative and vibrant place and we are trying to try and represent that through spirituality.&quot; </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Prison guard unions called for a &quot;general rally&quot; on Friday to demand payment of their bonuses and overtime before the end of the year holidays, having seen it pushed into January for budgetary reasons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> FO-pénitentiaire (2nd prison guard union) has requested that staff, who are not on duty, demonstrate Tuesday morning in front of prison buildings and to &quot;block&quot; them, in order to &quot;expose the theft of their earnings&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The CGT-pénitentiaire (3rd union in the profession) calls for them to &quot;unite in general, rallying at the various prisons, to show a strong turn-out&quot;, condemn the non-payment of &quot;overtime, night-shift bonuses, Sunday and holiday pay&quot; in December for their work in October as &quot;shameful and unacceptable&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> And the first prison guard union, Union fédérale autonome pénitentiaire (UFAP/UNSA), &quot;calls for general rallying (…) to re-awaken the discontent and anger&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The penitentiary administration&apos;s Management and the Justice Ministry explain that overtime has increased considerably in 2009 and was not fully covered in the budget, but assures that the outstanding balances will be settled in January. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Chancery stated near the end of the day that Michèle Alliot-Marie had sent a communication to the prison guard unions guaranteeing the payment would be made next month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> I am not ignoring the efforts made by the staff for the functioning and modernisation of our prison system, writes the Minister of Justice in this communication. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I have asked the penitentiary administration Management to put in place, without delay, a set of measures to ensure that this situation, caused by a poor evaluation of the number of additional work hours, does not repeat itself in the future, adds Mrs. Alliot-Marie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The December pay packet will therefore be slim, except for management staff, who benefit from the so-called target and position-related bonuses, critics the UFAP/UNSA, saying &quot;budgetary constraints are a convenient excuse&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> It is an absolute scandal, complains the inter-regional union from Marseilles, announcing its decision to boycott &quot;all meetings and convocations&quot; until further notice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Staff will not be putting in Sunday or holiday hours if the October ones are not settled in December, and the same goes for overtime, threatens the Rhône-Alpes-Auvergne trade union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> At a time when our goals and responsibilities are being expanded, but our staff numbers are not, it is more than regrettable to dare to attack the staff&apos;s salaries, judges the CGT-pénitentiaire de Bordeaux. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> According to the unions, the situation is not the same in all regions, with some being worse off than others. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Johnny Hallyday was re-operated on in Los Angeles due to significant &quot;lesions&quot; after an operation in France, but the situation is &quot;under control&quot; according to his entourage, while RTL claims that the singer has been placed in an artificial coma to avoid pain and complications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The 66-year-old rocker was re-operated on in the night between Wednesday and Thursday at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles after American doctors noted &quot;lesions resulting from the operation&quot; for the slipped disc undergone in Paris on November 26th, his press office announced in Paris, adding that the lesions had &quot;warranted a repair operation&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The singer&apos;s press office, however, wanted to be reassuring, stating that the situation was &quot;under control&quot;, while announcing that a new medical bulletin would be communicated within 48 hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to RTL, partner for the singer&apos;s first tour, however, Johnny Hallyday may have been put into an artificial coma to avoid &quot;pain and complications&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It will only be in 48 hours that we will have a little more certainty about the state of the patient, once he has at least one eye open, added RTL. </seg>
<seg id="7"> When questioned by the AFP, the press office neither confirmed, nor commented on the information. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> RTL also claims that &quot;according to certain sources&quot;, no drain was fitted after the first operation in Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The rocker had been operated on for a slipped disc at the international clinic at Parc Monceau. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The operation, scheduled several days in advance, had been carried out by the neuro-surgeon Stéphane Delajoux, a well-known doctor in artist circles. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He was not available to comment on RTL&apos;s information on Thursday evening. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Following the operation that he carried out on Johnny Hallyday, the singer was taken on Monday to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital for an infection stemming from the operation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The singer, Eddy Mitchell, a close friend of Johnny Hallyday, said on RTL on Thursday that his friend was going through &quot;a bad patch&quot;, but assured everyone that he had &quot;no worries&quot; about the rocker, who is a &quot;fighter&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> He had called me just before leaving for Los Angeles, and I told him that it was crazy, because taking a 12-hour flight after that kind of operation is not realistic, said Eddy Mitchell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Wednesday evening, the singer&apos;s producer, Jean-Claude Camus, had wanted to be reassuring, stating that Johnny Hallyday &quot;was reacting satisfactorily to the antibiotics&quot; and that the infection was being &quot;contained&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Mr. Camus had also said to have spoken with Laeticia, the singer&apos;s wife, and not to have noticed any signs of worry. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> But health problems for the singer have only multiplied since he was hospitalised for nine days in July after a fall on his yacht. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Two months later, to the surprise of all, Johnny Hallyday had revealed having had a &quot;minor colonic cancer&quot; operation, then a slight infection. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> At the end of September, the singer resumed as planned his long &quot;Tour 66&quot;, billed as his final goodbye tour. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Euro-2009/short course: Bousquet&apos;s first in his lucky distance </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Frenchman, Frédérick Bousquet, triple medal-holder in the long course 2009 World Championship, pulled off an international title for a distance he particularly favours, the 50m freestyle, at the Euro-2009 short course event in Istanbul on Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The first day of this competition, where full-length swimsuits are permitted for the last time, has seen only three world records beaten, whereas a wave of them was expected. </seg>
<seg id="4"> One record was improved on by the Hungarian, Evelyn Verraszto, 200m medly, and the two others by Russia in the 4x50m medly relay. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A regret for Bousquet, who had his sight set on the 50m freestyle world record, for which he holds the long course title (20.94). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> In one of the two high-profile swimming events, the 50m freestyle, it was the 28-year-old Frenchman who made his mark with a time of 20.53 in a final, where ten swimmers started instead of the usual eight - a first at the international level. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Bousquet bested the Croat, Duje Draganja (20.70) and the Russian, Sergey Fesikov (20.84), but he did not manage to reduce the world record time (20.30) as he had envisaged. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> One can always dream of better, and I had actually stated that, if the world record was in my reach, I would certainly attempt it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Like Bousquet, the vast majority of swimmers were in polyurethane swimsuits, which will not be permitted starting the 1st of January. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Having unleashed 238 world records since February 2008, these swimsuits will end their epic story in Istanbul, which had also seen the first ones in 1999, during the same competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The use of these swimsuits did not assist the German, Rome&apos;s long course two-time world champion this summer, Paul Biedermann, on this occasion, where world records were at stake. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The young swimmer did not succeed in reducing the record he currently holds in the 400m freestyle (3:32.77), but did, nevertheless, make an impression by achieving his second personal best time (3:34.55), ahead of the Russian, Nikita Lobintsev (3:35.75) and the Dane, Mads Glaesner (3:36.82). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> I did not give it my all in this race. </seg>
<seg id="14"> I knew that I could not achieve a world record, but I managed to defend my title and have accomplished my mission. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Lobintsev will be a strong rival in the future, explained Biedermann. </seg>

<seg id="1"> USA: a sarcophagus panel belonging to Zola fetches 1.5 million USD </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A Roman sarcophagus panel, which had notably belonged to the French writer, Emile Zola, fetched 1.5 million dollars on Thursday, a significantly higher figure than was estimated, announced art auction house Sotheby&apos;s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This front panel, measuring two metres in length and 63cm in height, dating back to the 3rd century AD, was valued at 150,000 to 250,000 dollars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The marble &quot;depicting four Dionysian scenes in a sophisticated architectural decor, surrounded by satyrs and bacchantes, is a rare piece; there are only five of them in the world&quot;, Florent Heintz, vice-president of art auctions for Roman and Egyptian antiquities, had explained to the AFP on Tuesday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It was sold among around a hundred other lots. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The auction is still going on, but this lot is certainly the one, which has got buyers bidding most so far, commented Sotheby&apos;s spokesman to the AFP, Dan Abernethy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The discovery of Emile Zola&apos;s acquisition of this marble piece dates back some time. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The panel remained in the famous collection of the Borghese family in Rome for nearly 300 years, then it successively appeared with the French actress, Cécile Sorel, who had made it a feature of her bathroom in her private Paris mansion, then Paul Reynaud, a minister in France&apos;s 3rd Republic and briefly the Council&apos;s chairman before Marshal Pétain&apos;s accession to power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> That left a grey area of about fifty years. </seg>
<seg id="10"> By searching the Louvre Museum&apos;s database, Florent Heintz discovered that the panel was part of an &quot;Emile Zola inheritance&quot; opened in 1903, a year after the death of the author of &quot;Thérèse Raquin&quot; and the series of &quot;Rougon-Macquart&quot; novels. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zelaya&apos;s departure attempt from Honduras to Mexico aborted </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Mexico judged on Thursday that conditions were no longer suitable for the transfer into its territory of the deposed Honduran president, Manuel Zelaya, who had been refused safe passage by the coup-installed Government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> At the moment, after a telephone conversation in the night with president Zelaya, everything seems to indicate that the potential options for carrying out this transfer are not suitable, declared the Mexican Secretary of Foreign Affairs, Patricia Espinosa. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Having arrived on Wednesday in El Salvador to bring back Mr. Zelaya, the Mexican Government plane returned to its original location, according to a source from the General Directorate of Migrations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Coup Government had wanted to force Mr. Zelaya to &quot;resign&quot; and had requested a foreign asylum to allow him safe passage to. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But the president refused, because he wanted to travel to Mexico as the incumbent Head of State and an invited guest. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Coup Government &quot;has again met with failure by wanting me to give up my duties (...); they wanted me to resign&quot;, Mr. Zelaya told radio Globo on Thursday, through which he often makes himself heard, since the beginning of the political crisis, which has so far lasted five months in this country of Central America. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> I could stay here ten years, I have my guitar here, added the deposed president while playing a few chords, having taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy in Tegucigalpa for the last two and a half months. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Mexican Embassy presented us with a request for safe passage, but, unfortunately, we could not accept it because it did not contain an asylum request, the Coup Government Interior Minister, Oscar Raul Matute, had declared on Wednesday on Honduran HRN radio. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> I am not requesting asylum from any country, Manuel Zelaya had answered in an interview on the Telesur channel, based in Caracas. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Any departure from Honduras would have to be as the president of the Honduran people, he had emphasised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The rumours of Mr. Zelaya&apos;s departure had, on Wednesday, mobilised the partisans of the deposed president, who gathered around the Brazilian Embassy, where military forces reinforced their position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Brazilian Foreign Minister, Celso Amorim, criticised the Coup Government&apos;s position. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This demonstrates the marginal character of this Government in relation with international standards, he asserted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Zelaya, who had become closer with the socialist Venezuelan president, Hugo Chavez, had been overturned on June 28th, the day he had organised a public consultation to prepare for his re-election, going against the views of the Supreme Court, the Army and Congress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Exiled to Costa Rica, he had made a surprise return on September 21st and had taken refuge at the Brazilian Embassy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> If he comes out, he will be arrested to answer to charges of &quot;high treason&quot;, which the Law accuses him of, according to the Coup Government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The Coup President, Roberto Micheletti, has managed to organise a presidential election on the 29th of November to replace Mr. Zelaya. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Porfirio Lobo was elected in the controversial vote, which was recognised by the United States, but was contested by Latin American countries such as Venezuela, Argentina, and Brazil. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Three days later, Congress voted by a landslide against Mr. Zelaya&apos;s return to power for the remainder of his term up to January 27th. </seg>

<seg id="3"> According to the final closing figures, the Dow Jones Industrial Average rose by 68.78 points to 10 405.83 points, and the NASDAQ, with a technology dominance, rose by 7.13 points to 2 190.06 points. </seg>

<seg id="5"> We have good news coming from various sides of the Economy, assessed Lindsey Piegza from FTN Financial. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, this remains anecdotal evidence, she cautioned, suggesting the market was focusing on &quot;the glass being half full&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Cuba: hundreds of Government supporters speak out against the &quot;Ladies in White&quot; </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Several hundred Cuban pro-government demonstrators spoke out on Thursday against political prisoners&apos; wives, who had gathered in Havana for International Human Rights Day, and prevented another demonstration, for which around a dozen dissidents were arrested. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Around forty &quot;White Ladies&quot;, wives and those close to the political prisoners, were jeered at in the street by supporters of Raul Castro&apos;s government as they were marching towards the centre of the capital to demand the liberation of the political prisoners, observed an AFP reporter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Down with the Yanks!, &quot;Mercenaries!&quot;, &quot;The street belongs to the Revolutionaries!&quot;, &quot;Long live Fidel and Raul!&quot; the pro-government supporters chanted at the dissidents, their fists raised. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These latter were escorted by plainclothes agents, who had come to &quot;ensure their protection&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The previous evening, a similar demonstration had taken place against the &quot;Ladies in White&quot; in Havana without anyone being injured or arrested. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> However, in the Vedado district of Havana, a dozen dissidents, who were also preparing to demonstrate Thursday for the International Human Rights Day, were arrested by plainclothes police, reported an AFP journalist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The policemen made the dissidents, who had been jeered at by pro-government supporters, get into unmarked vehicles, according to the journalist. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Dissident arrests under similar circumstances normally only last a few hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Recipients of the 2005 Sakharov Prize from the European Parliament, the &quot;Ladies in White&quot; had organised a non-authorised march to &quot;demand the release of all political prisoners&quot;, totalling 200 according to the dissident side, declared one of their leaders, Laura Pollan, whose husband, Hector Maceda, is serving a 20-year sentence in prison. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Mr. Maceda is part of the group of 75 Cuban dissidents arrested in March 2003, 53 of which remain behind bars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Cuban authorities consider the opposition as &quot;mercenaries&quot; or &quot;agents&quot; on the books of their sworn enemy, the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Unusually, Cuban television covered the demonstration of pro-government supporters against the &quot;anti-revolutionaries&quot; on Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Cuba, lead by a single party, the Communist Party, is regularly accused by European or American NGOs of flouting rights and liberties, notably those of the freedom of expression. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A madman kills an eighty-year-old with a knife and wounds 5 at Clichy-la-Garenne </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A crazed man armed with two knives has killed a man in his eighties and wounded five other people in the city centre of Clichy-la-Garenne (Hauts-de-Seine), during rush hour, towards the end of Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> We have learned from witnesses and from police that, according to the investigation&apos;s initial findings, the attacker, aged 28, appears to have struck an eighty-year-old with two knives for reasons that remain unclear, in or at the front of a pharmacy at 85 Boulevard Jean-Jaurès. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Having sustained severe wounds, the elderly man, born in 1929 according to the police union, Alliance, died from his injuries in the hospital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In or in front of the same pharmacy, he then began attacking a couple, including a pregnant woman. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The husband, aged around thirty, came between them and was wounded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The first two victims, gravely wounded, were admitted to the hospital, where the eighty-year-old man died. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The days of the other injured person may be numbered, as vital organs have apparently been affected, according to police sources. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The pregnant woman was subsequently taken ill and was hospitalised &quot;in a state of shock&quot;, according to one police source. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The armed man, who appeared to be under the influence of alcohol or drugs, according to a police source, fled into the street along Boulevard Jean Jaurès. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He is reported to have wounded two passers-by, apparently at random: one thirty-year-old, and one forty-year-old, the latter severely. </seg>
<seg id="12"> By the evening, the scenario remained unclear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> He was armed with two butcher&apos;s knives that he carried crossed on his back, explained Arnaud Pressé at the scene, an officer from the Alliance union of Hauts-de-Seine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Several passers-by, including some youngsters, attempted to overpower the madman, according to witness reports collected by the AFP. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> I saw a guy of about thirty with a green jacket. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Three youths tried to intervene. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They could not manage it, because the guy was well-built, recounted Alberto, a server in a nearby bar. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A crowd fell on him, including a town policeman, who broke his wrist, he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Still on Jean-Jaurès Boulevard, outside number 61, two town policemen, one of whom was the chief, attempted to arrest the armed man and were injured by punches, according to police sources. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The events took place on one of Clichy-la-Garenne&apos;s main streets, where many local businesses operate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Some passers-by came to tell me that there was someone injured outside. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I went out, saw a 70-year-old on the ground, put the person in the recovery position, then I noticed a severe wound on the abdomen, Frédéric Allione, a 35-year-old pharmacist, told the AFP. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Five minutes later, a second person arrived, aged around thirty, with knife wounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> National police officers were the ones who arrested the man, who was not carrying any identification documents. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The case will be brought to the Nanterre Public Prosecutor&apos;s Office by the region&apos;s police service for Hauts-de-Seine (SDPJ 92). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The madman was taken to a hospital on Thursday evening. </seg>
<seg id="27"> He had not yet had a chance to speak after being taken into custody. </seg>
<seg id="28"> A police source did not exclude the possibility of him being committed to a psychiatric hospital. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> According to another police source, six policemen were needed to subdue the man at the police station in Clichy, where he was taken. </seg>

<seg id="1"> USA: Polanski&apos;s lawyer calls afresh for proceedings to be dropped </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The lawyer of the Franco-Polish film director, Roman Polanski, called again in Los Angeles on Thursday (California, western United States), for the abandonment of proceedings against his client, who is currently under house arrest in Switzerland for a vice case that is over 30 years old. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Chad Hummel, the lawyer for the director of &quot;The Pianist&quot; cited grave errors in the procedures at the time of the events in 1977, in front of three judges at the Court of Appeal of California&apos;s second district. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> I am calling for charges to be dropped here and now, declared Mr. Hummel, before adding that the behaviour of the judge, who was dealing with the case at the time, Laurence Rittenband, &quot;sends chills down the spine&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> According to him, judge Rittenband -- since deceased -- is said to have spoken with one of the prosecutors, who told him that Roman Polanski deserved prison, before passing sentence -- constituting a serious error in procedure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> This discussion had been revealed in the documentary &quot;Roman Polanski: wanted and desired&quot;, the words coming straight from the prosecutor in question, David Wells. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> However, Mr. Wells had eventually declared that he had &quot;lied&quot; to the author of the documentary at the end of September. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> In the event of the court&apos;s refusal to abandon proceedings, Mr. Hummel called for a trial to be held, which would allow him to present evidence to back his arguments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Prosecution, for its part, has re-iterated its argument, already formed in the first instance, that no abandonment of the charges could be seriously looked at while Roman Polanski did not present himself in court. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The 76-year-old filmmaker had fled the United States before his sentence had been passed for &quot;unlawful sexual relations&quot; with a 13-year-old minor. </seg>
<seg id="11"> He has not set foot in the United States since. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The deputy prosecutor for Los Angeles County, Phyllis Asayama, therefore declared that Roman Polanski &quot;must be present at the hearing&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> For this case, are we trying to send the message, not just to (Roman Polanski) but also other defendants, that it is ok to flee? asked Mrs. Asayama. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In her view, the filmmaker &quot;is asking a favour from the court, while at the same time showing disregard for its authority&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> One of the three judges -- who now have 90 days to return their verdict -- has also emphasised &quot;that there are other alternatives to fleeing&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Mr. Hummel was not the only one to request that proceedings against Roman Polanski be abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The lawyer of Samantha Geimer, the victim, also called once again for an end to the proceedings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Reminding that her client can no longer stand to be harassed with every resurfacing of the Polanski case, she added: &quot;No one in this room can claim that this was a just procedure. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Thirty two years is enough&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Roman Polanski was arrested on the 26th of September in Switzerland on an American warrant. </seg>
<seg id="21"> After more than two months behind bars, he was put under house arrest at his chalet in Gstaad, pending his possible extradition. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> During this grand beauty congregation organised for the second consecutive year around Johannesburg, five of them have already landed their tickets to the semi-final. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Miss Japan, Eruza Sasaki, Perla Beltran Acosta of Mexico, Mariatu Kargbo of Sierra Leone, Kaiane Aldorino from Gibraltar, and Yanbing Ma from Canada have been elected Miss World Sportswoman or also Miss World Top Model during their African stay. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It was a real whirlwind. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To visit beautiful cities like Port Elizabeth, Durban, and Cape Town is extraordinary. </seg>
<seg id="7"> I saw so many things and I have so much new experience, said Miss of Sierra Leone. </seg>
<seg id="8"> This competition, which is taking place in South Africa for the ninth time, will be transmitted live on Saturday from Midrand, north of Johannesburg, starting at 17:00 (15:00 GMT). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> I could not have dreamed of a better country to award my crown. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The experience was fascinating. </seg>

<seg id="18"> Candidates will parade in traditional outfits and, of course, in swimsuits. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The show will be presented by Angela Chow, an ethnic Chinese television presenter, the South African ex-beauty queen Michelle McLean, and an officer from the Miss World Committee, Steve Douglas. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="21"> The candidates went on safari, as they did last year, visited the famous township of Soweto, but this time by bicycle, and sampled the local cuisine. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Exceptionally, they also met the South African president, Jacob Zuma, who shook their hands. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Unusual for a head of State, notes Miss Sierra Leone. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The news about Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive&quot;, according to son David </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The news about Johnny Hallyday &quot;is very positive&quot;, assures his son, David, on Friday arriving at the airport in Los Angeles, where he was to be by his father&apos;s bedside, who has been in hospital for several days. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The news is very positive. </seg>
<seg id="4"> He is very strong, all will go well, declared his son, David Hallyday, to the Press on leaving the plane from Paris just after 13:00 local time (21:00 GMT). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The singer&apos;s son had a relaxed air and assured that he would be heading &quot;without delay&quot; to the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where Johnny Hallyday was admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on November 26th in Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The singer was &quot;put in an artificial coma tonight in Los Angeles for comfort reasons, to prevent his suffering, and to allow his treatment to be administered&quot;, indicated the press service. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Johnny Hallyday had already been put in an artificial coma by doctors at the Cedars-Sinaï hospital in Los Angeles, where he had been admitted on Monday for an infection stemming from a slipped disc operation on the 26th of November in Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The singer had to be operated on in the night from Wednesday to Thursday because of significant lesions resulting from the operation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> His wife, Laeticia, went on Friday morning to the Los Angeles French High School, where their daughter Jade is enrolled, to attend a school performance, observed an AFP photographer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Head of Orthopaedic and Trauma Surgery of the Pitié-Salpêtrière hospital, Yves Catoné, announced that he would travel to see the singer in Los Angeles on Monday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The producer vehemently brought into question Dr. Stéphane Delajoux, the neuro-surgeon, who operated on the singer on the 26th of November at the International Clinic of Parc Monceau in Paris. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> They told us it was carnage. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Los Angeles surgeons said they were aghast, declared Mr. Camus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> I heard talk of possible legal proceedings to come, he said. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jean-Claude Camus reckoned that Johnny Hallyday had &quot;left far too soon for Los Angeles, with the Paris surgeon&apos;s authorisation&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="16"> I had this doctor on the phone in person, and he assured me that there was no problem for this trip, which shocked me, as I, myself, have had two slipped discs, he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Shortly before, on RTL, he had indicated that the singer apparently &quot;had left without a drain or anything&quot;, following his Paris operation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Dr Stéphane Delajoux is well-known in artistic circles. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He had operated on the actress Marie Trintignant in Vilnius a few days before her death at a clinic in Neuilly-sur-Seine, where he practiced at the time. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 2007, he had also operated on the actress Charlotte Gainsbourg to resorb a haematoma, following a cerebral haemorrhage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> However, he is also a doctor with a notorious reputation, convicted by the Law on several occasions, in cases of medical liability, as well as for fraud and tax evasion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Olivier Metzner, the lawyer for the Doctors&apos; governing body, accused him of being &quot;a man without scruples&quot;, who &quot;regularly&quot; has to answer to the governing body&apos;s Council, and who is &quot;far from reputable&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> After several days of silence, Dr. Stéphane Delajoux made an announcement on Friday through his solicitor, David Koubbi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The latter indicated that the operation had &quot;gone perfectly well&quot; and that post-operation tests returned &quot;normal&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The operation &quot;was not haemorrhagic and therefore did not required a drain to be fitted&quot;, he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In any case, the singer&apos;s tour, for whom health problems have been multiplying since the summer, would seem to be on hold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Clearly, resuming the tour on the 8th of January [in Amiens] as planned seems very soon, declared Mr. Camus. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The UDF alliance speaks out and orders the New Centre party to stop using its acronym </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UDF alliance, controlled by François Bayrou&apos;s Democratic Movement (MoDem), reacted on Friday to the buy-out bid made by the New Centre&apos;s president, Hervé Morin, for the acronym of the former Giscardian party, by ordering him not to use it under any circumstances, threatening legal action otherwise. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Hervé Morin announced publicly that he intended to recoup the UDF acronym, ruling that François Bayrou was not worthy of its political heritage, having extended his hand to the Left. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Defence Minister, whose party is partner to the UMP, had in fact planned to confirm this strategy on Saturday before the NC&apos;s national Council. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In support of his move, he received backing from deputy Hervé de Charette (ex-UMP switched to NC), who claims his ownership of the UDF trademark by being the first to record it in 2004 at the National Industrial Property Institute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, Friday evening, the UDF Alliance&apos;s office, headed by François Bayrou&apos;s friends, who do not plan to give up possession, has come out of silence to launch an attack against the deputy, ordering him not to use the acronym, and to transfer the trademark&apos;s ownership to them, otherwise threatening legal action. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the last few days, you have stepped up the number of declarations indicating that you were going to propose political action to regain the UDF acronym, the alliance writes in a communication signed by 19 out of the 24 members of the office, including François Bayrou and Marielle de Sarnez from the MoDem, as well as the senator, Jean Arthuis, from the centre Alliance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> You also thought it acceptable to include in your campaign literature and on your website&apos;s homepage the movement&apos;s name, the New Centre, and to follow it with the slogan: today&apos;s UDF, remark those who signed the document. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> As you are well aware, you have no right to the use of the acronym, explains the UDF&apos;s office, requiring that the NC remove &quot;immediately any mention of the UDF name from all material, and from (their) internet site&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> He also requests that Hervé de Charette &quot;transfer ownership of the trademark to its rightful owners&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> If you failed to do this, the matter would be referred to the courts to ensure that the Law and the legitimate rights of UDF members were respected, warn the document&apos;s signatories. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In their communication, they specify that the UDF &quot;is a political movement in its own right since 1978&quot; and points out that Mr. Morin and his friends had &quot;made their choice&quot; to leave him in 2007 &quot;to create a competing movement, as others had done in 2002, to establish the UMP&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The New Centre, according to them, has therefore no right to the use of the UDF acronym (Union for French Democracy). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> They also remind that the UDF&apos;s last assembly voted in 2007 for its union with the MoDem for three years, and for the creation of an office charged with defending &quot;the material and moral interests&quot; of the body founded by Valéry Giscard d&apos;Estaing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> As for Hervé de Charette, the office continues, &quot;when he registered the trademark&quot;, he had &quot;not been a UDF member for three years&quot;, but, in fact, with the UMP. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He is profiting in a scandalous and fraudulent manner from the absence of a registered trademark for the UDF acronym by taking it to benefit his own account. </seg>
<seg id="17"> This incident is turning into a major offence, they state, before adding ironically about the NC&apos;s strategy that: &quot;in our opinion, in politics as in real life, it is more dignified to make one&apos;s own name rather than try to become somebody by fraudulently acquiring a name we have no right to&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Liliane Bettencourt Case: François-Marie Banier will be tried for &quot;abuse of weakness&quot; </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Nanterre tribunal decided on Friday to bring François-Marie Banier to trial to ascertain whether, as the daughter of billionairess Liliane Bettencourt is accusing him, he profited from the eighty-year-old&apos;s weakened mental state to despoil her of some of her fortune. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The photographer, 62, known for his photographs of the stars, will be tried on the 15th and 16th of April 2010 for &quot;abuse of weakness&quot;, an offence that carries a maximum penalty of three years in prison and a 375 000 euro fine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The decision confirms that there will indeed be a trial in this case, which is turning into a worthy family saga involving one of the richest families in France, where mother and daughter are torn apart, while at the reins of the L&apos;Oréal cosmetics empire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> However, the 15th Magistrate&apos;s Court has also ordered a combined expert medical opinion of Liliane Bettencourt, aged 87, to be led by three doctors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The heiress and principal shareholder of L&apos;Oréal has always refused to undergo such an exam, at least not with the conditions proposed by the Nanterre court at the time of the investigation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The doctors nominated on Friday will have to submit a report by the 10th of March, 2010, stating, in particular, whether Liliane Bettencourt could have found herself in a weakened state and at which times. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> I think she will submit to it. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I will talk with her about it, declared Mrs. Bettencourt&apos;s lawyer, Georges Kiejman, at the exit of the hearing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For his part, the lawyer of Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers, Olivier Metzner, congratulated himself on the court&apos;s decision. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is excellent news (…) The expert opinion will prove that he (Mr. Banier) manipulated this elderly lady, whom we should be protecting, he affirmed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> For two years, Liliane Bettencourt&apos;s daughter and only child has engaged in taking to court the case against François-Marie Banier, the photographer and all-round artist, whom she accuses of profiting for years from her mother&apos;s weakness to obtain a billion euros in donations, in the form of cheques, life insurance contracts, or works of art. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As far as she is concerned, Liliane Bettencourt has always refuted having been manipulated by the photographer, who she considers a long-standing friend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> As the court on Friday was due to examine the admissibility of the case brought by Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers, the pleas from the lawyers at times turned proceedings into an unveiling of intimate family matters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Thus, Liliane Bettencourt&apos;s lawyer cited three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003, and 2005) to her solicitor, in which she expressed having suspicions about Françoise Bettencourt-Meyers&apos; husband. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the letter dated from 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to the lawyer: &quot;could you explain to my daughter that I wrote to Mr. Banier once or twice a day for fifteen years.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="17"> I have been unable to speak to Françoise since her marriage&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> For its part, the Court in Nanterre has again ruled that the plaintiff&apos;s claim was not admissible for action, all the more so after a judge supervising guardianship refused her request in the past few days to initiate a procedure allowing legal protection for her mother. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Liliane Bettencourt &quot;is fully capable of participating in legal proceedings, she is not under protection and does not have a guardian. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Nobody needs to act on her behalf&quot;, affirms the Public Prosecution&apos;s representative, Marie-Christine Daubigney. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The Court determined that it would make a ruling once the case concerning the admissibility of Mrs. Bettencourt-Meyers&apos;s claim had taken place. </seg>

<hl>
<seg id="1"> A management revolution or the end of competitive intelligence? </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> If nothing changes in the way France&apos;s biggest enterprises are run, our fight for the development of competitive intelligence will have been in vain… </seg>
<seg id="3"> For over ten years, the Management&apos;s attitude in large enterprises towards their employees reflects the position of enterprises and their consumers before the marketing revolution: employees should be made to adhere to &quot;values&quot; dictated from above just as it was in the past, when products dreamed up by the factory&apos;s engineers were dropped on the consumer. </seg>
<seg id="4"> By placing the consumer at the heart of the organisation, the marketing revolution put the strategies for conquering markets the right way up again... even if authoritarian temptation to impose products, which are disconnected from the preferences of the consumer tend to resurface regularly! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> A demobilisation of employees can lead to terminal demoralisation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Suicides at France Telecom, PSA and Renault are only the visible part of a far more widespread problem that affects management employees in particular. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Demobilisation gravely compromises the development of an organisation&apos;s strategic functions, notably in R&amp;D, but even more so in competitive intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Indeed, CI &quot;demands from all sides concerned (...) a proactive approach and a long-term vision&quot;; it requires from employees a commitment that is entirely contradicted by authoritarian management methods. </seg>
<seg id="9"> For this reason, we are calling for a management revolution, which would consist in placing employees at the centre of an enterprise&apos;s concerns alongside consumers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The very relative usefulness of internal opinion surveys </seg>
<seg id="11"> Will internal opinion surveys - such as those given by Orange to its employees - stimulate this revolution in managerial methods? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Unfortunately, I fear it will not. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> - Firstly, because I have witnessed that, when faced with a new situation, any organisation will arrive, after many detours, at doing chiefly... what it always does! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> - Next, because authoritarianism - a disease of power - grows proportionally with the magnitude of its own failures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> - Finally, because most leaders have a simplistic view of human behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Coming from the top technical educational establishments, they have a mechanistic interpretation of psychology. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They adopt, for intellectual convenience, the old behaviourist theory, which has recently been re-awakened by the &quot;neuro-sciences&quot; of the United States that have been widely and silently diffused by business institutes and the Media. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In this way, by suggesting that &quot;levers&quot; [sic] can be pulled for the commitment of management staff, a recent Ipsos survey published on Figaro.fr cradles leaders into a position of mechanistic governance, which is unsuited to the world of today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Identify and quantify mobilisation factors </seg>
<seg id="20"> In contrast, the management revolution needed for the correct functioning of modern enterprises supposes the adoption of a finalistic vision of human behaviour. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It consists in the integration, within all management strategies and practices, of a fundamental admission: for employees, commitment to the enterprise is only possible if it is clearly perceived as a means to realising a part of their dreams, their ambitions, and their plans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Currently, only studies produced through motivation factor analysis adopt the concept of employee motivation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> These studies have demonstrated that they form a view of their organisation based on a pre-determined consensus of opinion, which allows them, by means of this perceived view, to evaluate what it offers them to achieve their life plans. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> By identifying and gauging these mobilisation factors, enterprise leaders can control, predict and anticipate their &quot;social performance&quot; and turn their management of resources &quot;the right way round&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="25"> They thereby create a favourable terrain for the concerted development of robust and effective competitive intelligence. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The American Right paid tribute to the speech given the previous evening in Oslo by Barack Obama, satisfied that the Nobel Peace Prize 2009 had defended the concept of a &quot;just war&quot; against the enemies of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The conservatives, who had mocked the awarding of the Prize to Obama on October 9th, were this time giving the presidential speech their applause, lead by Sarah Palin, former vice-president candidate during the 2008 elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> I liked what he said, declared Mrs. Palin, right-wing champion of the Republican party, to the daily newspaper USA Today, adding that she had herself touched on the topic of war that is &quot;sometimes necessary&quot; in her memoirs, which have just been published. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> War is, of course, one of the last things, which Americans want to get involved in, but it is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="6"> We must stop these terrorists over there, she affirmed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr. Obama, who has inherited the two wars from his predecessor, George W. Bush, in Iraq and Afghanistan, applied himself on Thursday in Oslo to justifying resorting to force, a way to explain his decision to send 30 000 additional troops to Afghanistan nine days earlier. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Another one of Mr. Obama&apos;s opponents, Newt Gingrich, concluded that the president had done &quot;very good work&quot; in Oslo. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I found his speech to be really very good, approved the former Speaker in the House of Representatives, who had particularly valued the mention that &quot;Evil does exist in the world&quot; in the presidential discourse. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> From certain viewpoints, I found this speech to be of historic significance, declared Mr. Gingrich, during an interview for the radio show &quot;The Takeaway&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The former representative, considered by some a possible candidate for the Republican inauguration of the 2012 presidential elections, was delighted to see &quot;a president from the Left&quot; remind the Noble Committee members &quot;that they would not be free and in a position to award a peace prize if resorting to force had not been an option&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> For Michael Gerson, a former writer for George W. Bush and re-converted columnist for the Washington Post, Mr. Obama has given &quot;a very American speech&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> As well as presenting himself as a &quot;world citizen&quot;, as &quot;he always does&quot;, &quot;he spoke like an American President&quot;, reminding Europeans &quot;that they live in a security bubble, which they did not create and they are doing little to preserve&quot;, declared Mr. Gerson. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Among the few unconvinced right-wingers, a hawkish character from the Bush era, the former UN ambassador, John Bolton, described the speech as &quot;drab, turgid, and uninspired&quot; on the National Review Online&apos;s website. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> To the president&apos;s left, the democratic representative Dennis Kucinich was alarmed to see Barack Obama justify resorting to force. </seg>
<seg id="16"> When we wrap war inside the notion of justice, the massacre of innocent people can easily be justified, he warned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Centre-left Press nevertheless remained full of praise for the president. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The Los Angeles Times, still of the opinion that the Nobel Prize had been prematurely awarded to Mr. Obama, described his address as &quot;a blockbuster&quot;, even for a speaker that is known for his talent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The Oslo speech &quot;should serve as a roadmap for guiding international decisions made on conflicts, poverty and oppression&quot;, enthused the Californian newspaper. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Following three marathon sessions of negotiations, transport unions and the TLF, the only employer&apos;s organisation to have remained to the end, reached an agreement on Friday evening that will end the strike order and the threat on Christmas deliveries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> During the signing on Friday evening, Transport Secretary Dominique Bussereau was &quot;delighted&quot; with the agreement after several rounds of negotiations on Wednesday morning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> After a second night of discussions, negotiating sides left in the small hours with the hope of a swift signing of the agreement&apos;s text later in the morning. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And this, despite three employers&apos; organisations (FNTR, UNOSTRA, OTRE) having slammed the door. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, it took a further six hours from a meeting that started at 11am for everyone to be in agreement, and for the text to be signed at 6pm. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The disagreement &quot;would have been very damaging for the companies&quot; and &quot;it looked like it might threaten the end of year festivities&quot;, Mr. Bussereau stated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The document allows for a 4% increase in salaries for the lowest ones (in local and regional road transport), and a 2.9% increase for higher ones (international transport). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Hourly rates, for those on lower pay, &quot;go from 8.72 euros to 9.06. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It is not much, but we have come a long way, explains Patrice Clos (Worker&apos;s Union). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> This evening we will give the order to our campaigners not to form blockades or picket at delivery depots. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There may, however, always be a few difficult ones, who remain uncooperative, he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Philippe Grillot, president of the TLF, paid tribute to &quot;a good agreement&quot;, even if it was &quot;difficult to concede the increases on the higher salaries given international competition&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to him, the increases will be of the order of 170 euros per month for the lower salaries and from 100 to 120 euros for the higher ones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> It is a common sense agreement, respecting the workers, declared Maxime Dumont (CFDT), while Thierry Douine (CFTC) praised it as &quot;a historic agreement&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As for Richard Jaubert (CGT), he described it as &quot;an acceptable compromise&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The agreement also allows for a rise in travel expenses of 3% and maintaining current general road transport conditions for the first half of 2010, which will give room for dealing with the questions of a 13th month&apos;s pay and the modernisation of the collective labour agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Mr. Bussereau reminded everyone that &quot;a 100 million euro cut in employers&apos; charges&quot; had been the subject of a Government amendment in corrective financial legislation for 2009, voted on in the night from Thursday to Friday at the National Assembly. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The Government will ask that the Senate vote on it &quot;in the same timeframe&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The signature from the TLF allows the agreement to be applied in the first instance to all the companies that are members of the organisation, and secondly, to the whole profession, subject to it being extended by the Minister for Labour. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It will be done &quot;in a very short time&quot;, assures Mr. Bussereau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The opposing employers&apos; organisations can only delay the process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The FNTR called it a &quot;sham&quot;, because the 100 million euros &quot;had already been promised to the sector in compensation for part of the carbon tax&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The Transport Secretary urgently forced us to the negotiating table, not with the aim of a two-sided review, but to avoid upsetting the turkey-eaters this Christmas, deplores the UNOSTRA. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> On Friday, approximately one out of two trains ran at peak times, with almost no trains at all during off-peak periods, as planned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> As on Thursday, there was no trouble with crowds on the platforms, as Parisians had gotten themselves organised. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Thus, in the early hours, the station at Saint-Germain-en-Laye (Yvelines) was far less busy than usual, notably because of the absence of school and college students. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> At Boissy-Saint-Léger (Val-de-Marne), Jack Nbakina, a 29-year-old engineer, explained that he had gotten up &quot;an hour and a half earlier, to be sure of arriving on time&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="16"> It is not what the drivers, who are demanding the bonus they are owed, want, according to Thierry Garon (SUD). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The RATP has even put its offer of bonuses on hold, the CGT complained, pointing out that the management &quot;could not be bothered to resolve the problem, whereas road transport and the SNCF both have it done and dusted&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Turkish justice bans the pro-Kurd party, a decision laden with consequences </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Turkish Constitutional Court returned a verdict on Friday for the dissolution of the country&apos;s main pro-Kurd party, a decision which was immediately followed by angry protests within the Kurdish community in the Southeast of the country and in Istanbul. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The decision is likely to greatly complicate the Government&apos;s work, as it has just recently made positive gestures towards the Kurdish community in an attempt to resolve a 25-year old conflict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Party for a Democratic Society (DTP) was disbanded because it had become &quot;a hotbed of damaging activities against the State&apos;s independence and its unfailing unity&quot;, the President of the Court, Hasim Kiliç, declared to the press at the end of four days of deliberations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The decision was taken unanimously by the 11 judges, while a majority of seven was sufficient to force the disbanding, Mr. Kiliç indicated, adding that 37 of the party&apos;s representatives, including its president, Ahmet Türk, and the deputy, Aysel Tugluk, have been banished from political life for the next five years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The judge also announced the lifting of the parliamentary immunity, from which both Mr. Türk and Mrs. Tugluk benefited, and the confiscation of party assets by the Treasury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The DTP occupies 21 seats in Parliament (out of 550). </seg>
<seg id="8"> Its leaders had warned prior to the verdict that the representatives would leave Parliament rather than take their seats as representatives with no affiliation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The decision was taken following proceedings launched in 2007 by the prosecutor of the Appeal Court, Abdurrahman Yalçinkaya, who accuses the DTP of obeying &quot;directives&quot; from the Kurdistan Workers&apos; Party (PKK), which is considered to be a terrorist organisation by Ankara and in many countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Many observers believe the DTP serves as a legal political shop window for the PKK rebels. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The party maintains, however, that it has &quot;no organic links&quot; with the PKK, but refuses to recognise it as a terrorist organisation and is calling for the Government to open negotiations with it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The court&apos;s verdict comes at a time when the Government has extended its hand to the Kurdish community by proposing a series of measures, reinforcing its rights in an attempt to quash Kurdish support for the PKK and put an end to the conflict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> DTP leaders had stated that a dissolution of the party could lead to renewed tensions in the Anatolian Southeast, where a great number of protests against the terms for the detention of the PKK&apos;s head, Abdullah Öcalan, have degenerated into clashes with police in the last few weeks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> As soon as the Law made its announcement, a thousand protesters gathered before the DTP&apos;s buildings in Diyarbakir, the Southeast&apos;s main city, populated mainly by Kurds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Police forces fired tear-gas grenades and used water cannons, as demonstrators threw Molotov cocktails and stones with slings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Around a hundred people also demonstrated in Istanbul. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Following the verdict, Mr. Türk declared that the Law&apos;s decision would &quot;deepen the despair&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Turkey cannot resolve this [Kurdish] issue by banning a party, he told the Press. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The Government, a party rooted in Islamic influences, also condemned the decision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> We are opposed on principle to the closing down of parties. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It does not solve anything, declared the Energy Minister, Taner Yildiz. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> This decision puts a blowtorch to the Government&apos;s democratic olive branch, comments political analyst Ahmet Insel. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Of course, we can expect a reaction from the PKK, he added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> On Thursday, the PKK claimed responsibility for an attack that killed seven soldiers in the North of Turkey three days earlier, one of the bloodiest in the last few months. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> For many years, it was a secret city, inaccessible to Westerners. </seg>

<seg id="4"> Nowadays, the municipality with its 216,000 inhabitants 37 km from Moscow centre is regarded as Russia&apos;s Silicon Valley. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Important research and production facilities for micro and nano technology are located here. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In September 2008, representatives of Zelenograd made contacts with the Frankfurt science centre in Riedberg - with the university institutes and the companies of the Frankfurt Innovation Centre (FIZ). </seg>
<seg id="7"> There were several visits, and on Wednesday Zelenograd and Riedberg finally signed a &quot;protocol for closer cooperation&quot; in Frankfurt on Wednesday. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A Stuttgart brake block </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The impact and dimensions of Stuttgart 21 cannot be overestimated. </seg>
<seg id="3"> For its supporters, the project deals no less than with the &quot;new heart of Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Quite rightly so. S21 is far more than lowering a railway station, more than a gigantic construction project, which will plunge the city of the Baden-Württemberg state capital into a terrible chaos of building sites for a decade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Stuttgart 21 warn born out of the spirit of the 1980s. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Terminus stations with rails ending in the middle of towns were regarded as fossils of the 19th century in terms of traffic technology, which acted like brake blocks to contemporary rail traffic, as it used to take an awful lot of time to shift engines from back to front. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Pull in, stop briefly, pull out - that&apos;s the plan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And therefore, terminus stations were supposed to disappear: as in Frankfurt and Munich. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And in Stuttgart: a non-terminus station, which is approximately half way along the trans-European rail line between Paris and Budapest/Bratislava - hence the slogan of the &quot;heart of Europe&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="10"> S21 is actually being built now, although the vision of the 1980s has no longer been compatible with the reality for years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Even very ambitious planners have recognised that it is virtually unpayable to lower the stations in the capitals of Hesse and Bavaria. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Terminus stations also no longer have pulling in and out problems since the development of push-pull trains with railway traction units and control cabs at either end. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> And still: Stuttgart 21 along with the new ICE route to Ulm is now being started. </seg>
<seg id="14"> State and municipal politicians have enforced it. </seg>
<seg id="15"> German Rail is participating, also because the risks of the Republic&apos;s biggest single infrastructure project will be borne by the taxpayer and not the state company. </seg>
<seg id="16"> As regards urban development, the development can be more or less justified. </seg>
<seg id="17"> An urban area is being created which, if the planners&apos; computer-generated graphics are to be believed, will feature a lot of green. </seg>
<seg id="18"> For the rail traffic system, S21 is damaging. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The non-terminus railway station and the line extension are designed for passenger transportation, which - typical for the 1980s - is estimated to see huge growth. </seg>
<seg id="20"> At the time, there was no competition from no-frills airlines. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Contemporary traffic policy, however, should be prioritising the handling of freight transportation, as transport by rail far more environmentally friendly than by lorry on the road. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But the line to be built is not suitable for freight trains due to steep slopes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> More seriously, S21 also affects many other rail projects. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A good six billion euros are to be buried in the Swabian land. </seg>
<seg id="25"> That is the official figure. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Experts expect ten to fifteen billion to be more realistic. </seg>
<seg id="27"> One thing is for sure, the money will be missing at other nodes and bottlenecks in the network over the next decade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> A total of sixty major projects are on the list of the transport ministry. </seg>
<seg id="29"> One of the most important ones is to expand the some 180 km of the line through the Rhine valley. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Work has been continuing on the line in slow motion since 1987. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It is urgent to really put the foot down here. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But S21 will act as a brake block. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The Rhine valley line will become a bottleneck for international freight transportation: right in the heart of Europe. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The state government did not decide in parliament whether it would appeal against the verdict of Hesse&apos;s Administrative Court (VGH) to ban night flights. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The CDU/FDP coalition has commissioned experts to review the 400+-page VGH verdict, said economics minister Dieter Posch (FDP). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The VGH in Kassel recently confirmed in writing that the state would have to reorganise the ban on night flights in the event of building the planned northwest runway at Frankfurt Airport. </seg>
<seg id="5"> According to the verdict, the granting of 17 flights between 11 pm and 5 am, as planned by the state government, is not compatible with the protection of the population from flight noise as specified by law. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The coalition must decide by 4 January whether it will appeal the verdict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The opposition criticised this delay and called upon the government representatives to do without an appeal before the Federal Administrative Court in Leipzig. </seg>
<seg id="8"> SPD party leader Torsten Schäfer-Gümbel demanded the CDU and FDP to return to their promises to ban night flights, which they made before the election. Otherwise, this would have to be rated as the &quot;breaking of a promise&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is bloody difficult when you are allowed to keep one&apos;s word, said Greens leader Tarek Al-Wazir, alluding to the FDP election slogan &quot;We keep our word&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Minister Posch rejected the accusation from Schäfer-Gümbel that the state government was trying to achieve their night flights by &quot;skewing justice and playing tricks&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A detailed legal examination would take time. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The coalition does not want to operate on the basis of &quot;a brief first impression&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A quick choice </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It all happened a lot faster than expected. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Barely two weeks after the ZDF board of directors had pushed the acting editor-in-chief Nikolaus Brender out of office, the broadcaster is able to present his successor. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Yesterday evening, the committee wanted to vote on the appointment. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The favourite was Peter Frey, head of ZDF&apos;s main studio in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But ZDF did not confirm this - officially, not to anticipate the process. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, the plan not to further damage ZDF director Markus Schächter, if this suggestion were also not successful with the board of directors, will also have played its part. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Frey, Schächter&apos;s candidate, needs the support of nine of the 14 committee members. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The result of the vote was not known when going to press. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Two weeks ago Schächter had been unsuccessful at the board of directors with his suggestion to extend the agreement with Nikolaus Brender by another five years. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Only seven members voted for Brender, seven were against him. Brender&apos;s voting out was a severe blow to Schächter, albeit one to be expected. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Because the majority of the Union in the administrative board had signaled already weeks before the vote that they would not confirm Brender in office. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Roland Koch, the prime minister of Hesse, had organised the opposition to the editor-in-chief. </seg>
<seg id="14"> With the argument that ZDF&apos;s news broadcasts had lost viewers under Brender, he rejected a further term in office of the highly regarded editor-in-chief. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Until shortly before the election, there were therefore protests in which the exercising of political influence on the ZDF was castigated. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Most recently, 35 civil rights campaigners had even joined the debate and rated the actions of Koch to be in breach of the Constitution. </seg>
<seg id="17"> To no avail. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Personal details </seg>
<seg id="19"> Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 in Bingen. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He studied political and educational sciences and Romance studies. </seg>
<seg id="21"> He later worked for the Südwestfunk and the Frankfurter Rundschau. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> In 1983 Frey moved to the ZDF, initially to the heute-journal. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Subsequent activities: From 1988 to 1990 personal officer of the editor-in-chief; in 1991/92 correspondent in Washington; until 1998 head and presenter of the Morgenmagazin; until 2001 head of ZDF foreign affairs; then head of the ZDF head studio. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The Greens announced after the voting out of Brender, who was voted journalist of the year by the sector paper Medium Magazin only on Wednesday, to press constitutional charges. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Koch&apos;s opponent on the board of directors, the Rhineland-Palatine prime minister Kurt Beck, explained last week that the states should amend the ZDF treaty to the extend that staff suggestions of the director cannot be blocked by a politically motivated majority. </seg>
<seg id="26"> However, Beck too ruled out any removal of party politicians from the boards of directors of the ZDF. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Brender&apos;s expected successor, Peter Frey, had recommended himself to the board of directors with a clever move - by harshly criticising the committee immediately after it voted out Brender. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Thanks to this proof of editorial independence, both Schächter without losing face and the board of directors were able to vote for his appointment as editor-in-chief, without being suspected of promoting a partisan to this post. </seg>
<seg id="29"> In party calculations, Frey is reckoned to be a left-leaning liberal anyway. </seg>

<seg id="1"> University courses to be cleared out </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Partial success for students: After a year of educational strikes, the culture ministers of the states finally came around on Thursday: At a meeting of the Culture Minister and University Principals Conference, both parties agreed to improve the conditions of studying for bachelor and masters courses. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The students should, in the future, be in a position to master their studies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In particular, they agreed to reduce the number of exams: Every module shall, as a rule, be completed with one single exam. </seg>
<seg id="5"> In addition, the students&apos; workload shall be reviewed and &quot;a realistic and acceptable extent&quot; ensured. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Politicians and colleges also want to simplify the recognition of exams taken between the colleges inside and outside Germany. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The states undertake to organise more flexibly joint structural requirements for bachelor and masters courses. </seg>
<seg id="8"> State regulations deviating from this, shall not be imposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Less exams </seg>
<seg id="10"> Since the start of the student protests in June, culture ministers and university principals have been referring to the dictum of better studiability. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Now it is being filled with specific contents for the first time. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The so-called accreditation council has decided to, in part, dramatically reduce the number of exams: &quot;Every module ends, as a rule, with an exam,&quot; states the 30-page paper, which is to newly govern the admission of courses in part. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> With the &quot;clear reduction of the examination load&quot;, explains accreditation council chairman Reinhold Grimm, &quot;an undesirable development is to be stopped, which had a grave impact on studiability&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="14"> In addition, &quot;studiability&quot; is to be the core criterion for the organisation in the future. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Modules and contents &quot;shall be strictly reviewed&quot; as to whether &quot;unnecessary constrictions on the students in their choice of </seg>
<seg id="16"> events&quot; would be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The students are &quot;entitled to be granted leeway allowing and promoting initiative&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The rules are to apply for the admission of new but also for the review of existing courses. </seg>
<seg id="19"> They need to be &quot;reaccredited&quot; every five years, which, however, means that it may take until 2015 until all courses have been reviewed. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Ten accreditation agencies throughout Germany oversee this, which report to the Accreditation Council set up by the states. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The culture ministers had &quot;expressly&quot; urged the states in October to influence the agencies in such a way that the number of subjects is not too large and the exams regime not too strict. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> In some federal states, universities and colleges have already agreed on corresponding measures with the state ministries. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Rhineland-Palatine has promised additional funds for the further development of the Bologna process;so far, it is the only state to do so. </seg>
<seg id="24"> With this money, the colleges are, in particular, to set up tutor programmes and course consultations as well as strengthen exams and foreign offices. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The state and colleges plan to earmark 10 million euros for this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> In early 2010 the government wants to bring an amendment to the Universities Act before parliament. </seg>
<seg id="27"> According to it, only one exam should be necessary to complete a course model. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The course design is to become more flexible, while the recognition of past academic records at other universities is to become easier along with access to masters courses. </seg>
<seg id="29"> By the end of the coming year, all courses of the state are to be examined for their studiability. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The government and opposition had again argued over the study requirements in the state on Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> On top of praise, there was also criticism for the decisions. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The federal board of the Young Socialist University Groups demanded the design of education policy should no longer take place &quot;behind the closed doors&quot; of ministers and university principals. </seg>
<seg id="33"> After the educational strike, at the latest, students should now also &quot;have their say&quot; as those affected. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The future academics received support from the president of the Conference of University Principals (HRK), Margret Wintermantel: &quot;We need the experiences of the students,&quot; she said on Thursday at a meeting with the culture ministers, with whom the HRK was debating a joint reform paper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> The Education and Science Union (GEW) deemed the Bonn decisions to be not radical enough: It is demanding a legal claim, which would allow every graduate with a bachelor degree admission on a further masters course. </seg>
<seg id="36"> On the other hand, the states must ensure that for the current generation of bachelor students there are sufficient places on master courses with best-possible studying conditions, says GEW executive board member Andreas Keller. </seg>
<seg id="37"> The states must employ significantly more lecturers. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The culture ministers did, however, not issue a statement regarding free admission to masters courses. </seg>

<seg id="1"> More than a footnote to Herta Müller </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Going in and out of Germany is nice, virtually no checks...&quot; is the first line of a poem by the poet Werner Söllner, in which he describes in disturbing fragments a dissident&apos;s experience of arrival, who had gained freedom but simultaneously lost his language area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Werner Söllner, born in Romania&apos;s Banat in 1951, initially worked as a German and English teacher in Bucharest and later as an editor in a children&apos;s publishing house, before he moved to Frankfurt am Main in 1982. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Söllner has won several literature awards, in 1993 he was awarded the legendary Frankfurt Poetry Readings at the Goethe University, and since 2002 he has been head of the Hesse Literature Forum in the Mouson Tower in Frankfurt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He caused a major extra-literary stir last Tuesday during a conference in Munich, debating &quot;German literature in Romania in the reflection and distortion of its Securitate files&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Clearly unsettled and embarrassed, Söllner read out a statement, in which he admitted before Romano-German writer colleagues, i.e. Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak and Helmuth Frauendorfer, his participation as an IM for the Romanian secret service, Securitate. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Jointly with some of those present, Söllner 1989 had received the German language award in 1989. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The recruitment attempts started gradually, first in 1971. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I am, Söllner concluded, &quot;therefore someone, who did not put up enough resistance to the intimidation attempts of the Securitate.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="10"> The lyricist Werner Söllner is IM Walter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Virtually at the same time as the awarding of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller and her unmatched literary discussion of the mechanisms of dictatorships, the literary scene and, in particular, the community of German authors with Romanian roots is being shocked by a case which reveals the dark spots and perfidy of a political system based on control and spying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Werner Söllner is, inasmuch as can be said on the basis of the current knowledge, not only a perpetrator, but also a victim. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his Securitate file, IM Walter played a part, said after Söllner&apos;s confession the literary scholar Michael Markel and referred to the positive influence IM Walter had for him. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He &quot;boxed him out&quot; in all points which were dangerous for him at the time, said Markel. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He has a moral need to make this statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Söllner&apos;s statement was in this form unexpected before this audience, although the confession of a former dissident and his collaboration with the Romanian secret service is not entirely surprising. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Germany was a cosy habitat for the Security spies, as Herta Müller had already written in July in the Zeit newspaper after reading her own file, 914 pages. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Those affected, one can assume, will have guessed and in some cases even known whose real name was behind the code names of Sorin, Voicu and, of course, Walter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Contrary to the now very secure process of viewing Stasi files in Germany, the approach to the legacy of Securitate control is still very diffuse. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A systematic clarification has been undermined and hindered in recent years. </seg>
<seg id="21"> A National Council to Process Securitate Files (SNSAS), which is comparable to the Birthler Authority, was only set up in 1999, but the release of the files has been very slow. </seg>
<seg id="22"> A law regulating the administration of the files has only existed since 2005. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The fact that the influence of former Securitate members is still very big in Romania was proven after the announcement of the Nobel prize for Herta Müller by an interview, in which a former Securitate head from Timisoara spoke in derogatory terms of the prize winner. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They is psychotic, she was, after all, questioned more than once. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The infamy of power believed it could openly speak in the guise of freedom of speech. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The Söllner case does, as so often in connection with silent guilt, raise questions. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Why only now? Who fell victim? The level-headed reaction of the audience to Söllner&apos;s statement gives rise to the hope that a continuation of this chapter will be determined by the need for information than finger-pointing and shame. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Regarding the genesis of Herta Müller&apos;s oeuvre, who yesterday received the Nobel prize, it is more than a footnote. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The Champions League - a side dish </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It seemed as if a well-dressed field sales representative was just coming from a very nice Christmas party, where a sports items manufacturer had handed out goodies, when the new VfB coach Christian Gross in the company of an orange plastic bag from the supplier got in a called out Mercedes C class at a quarter past midnight. ¨ </seg>
<seg id="3"> The man with the striking bald head was still needing a chauffeur, as the town was still unknown to him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Otherwise he could have driven himself - after all, no alcohol was involved and the 55-year-old was not drunk. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A nice evening, but tomorrow the work would continue. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Or only just get going. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In the words of the Swiss national, who had only just been employed three days before: &quot;We may have reached the last sixteen,&quot; i.e. in the Champions League thanks to a 3:1 win over Unirea Urziceni from Romania, &quot;but we mustn&apos;t be blinded by the success: We are in for a brutal fight against relegation.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The &quot;far more important task&quot; is scheduled for Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The Champions League performance will have to be repeated in the day-to-day job of the league. </seg>
<seg id="10"> And the again revealed weaknesses after the three quick goals by Marica (5.), Träsch (8.) and Pogrebnyak (11.) will have to be stopped. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Draw </seg>
<seg id="12"> The last sixteen of the Champions League (first leg 16/17 + 23/24 February/second leg 9/10 + 16/17 March) will be drawn in Nyon on 18 December. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The joy over the excellent start of the Babbel successor therefore remained mute. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Not only with the apparent saviour, who had given the unsettled Stuttgart professionals self-confidence, commitment and joy in playing in a short period of time. </seg>
<seg id="15"> &quot;I addressed the players and told them that they must consider their strengths, and urged them to be more courageous,&quot; explained shrink Gross his so simple-sounding recipe for success, which no longer had any effect under therapist Babbel. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He set a certain magic alight, admitted Babbel fan Lehmann, &quot;When now impulses are given in football, things happen which are considered to be impossible&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="17"> And Sami Khedira, who became the man of the match thanks to his dynamic approach having been injured for weeks, tried to describe the &quot;phenomenon&quot; with the proverbial &quot;breath of fresh air&quot; and the work approach of the new boss: &quot;He is a man who takes drastic measures and demands discipline. </seg>
<seg id="18"> That is what we need in the current situation.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="19"> Under Babel this was clearly lacking. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> VfB Stuttgart is still not out of the woods, warns sports director Horst Heldt </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But VfB Stuttgart needs, more than anything, consistency. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Like Gross, players and managers were eager not to overestimate the win over the depleted and hopelessly overburdened defence of the Romanian guests. </seg>
<seg id="23"> They had also won in Glasgow before the horribly awakening three days later in Leverkusen in the 0:4, warned Khedira. </seg>
<seg id="24"> And sports director Horst Heldt pointed out that one aim of the season had been achieved, but that the other one was still a long way off. </seg>
<seg id="25"> We are not out of the woods yet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The fact that Heldt was not in any mood to celebrate on his 40th birthday and even on the first home win for three months, had to do with the events of the weekend, which were revived in the form of a TV interview with goalkeeper Jens Lehmann, which was screened immediately before the match. </seg>
<seg id="27"> There are decisions which other people take and not Jens, was Heldt&apos;s response to Lehmann&apos;s harsh criticism. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He had accused the directors of a lack of leadership, who had decided to replace the manager under pressure from pubescent fans. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The fact that his day off after matches had been cancelled, was also rated by Lehmann as a sign of a lack of authority and resentment. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Lehmann&apos;s statements were &quot;guided by pure egoism&quot;, replied Heldt and announced consequences for the keeper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> It is unlikely they will become friends for life. </seg>
<seg id="32"> But, after all, they agreed with everybody else that without the work done by the replaced team of coaches, the strong performance, both in terms of play and spirit, would not have been possible. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Babel and seine assistants had &quot;a great share in the success&quot;, said Heldt and Lehmann unanimously - and the man with the plastic bag also agreed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Worldcup heavyweight box match </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Heated duel in Berne: Challenger Kevin Johnson kept provoking world champion Vitali Klitchko with words and gestures. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But after twelve hard rounds, the Ukrainian defended his heavyweight title according to the WBC. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The verdict of the judges was unanimous. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Hamburg - Vitali Klitchko remains heavyweight boxing world champion. </seg>
<seg id="6"> On Saturday night in Berne the 38-year-old champion (the WBC association version,) beat the American Kevin Johnson unanimously by points (120:108, 120:108, 119:109). </seg>
<seg id="7"> For Klitchko this was his third successful defence of his title since his comeback in October 2008. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Before, the Ukrainian had already twice been world champion of the WBO and WBC associations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Unfortunately, the knock-out, which everybody had expected, did not materialise. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Klitchko extended his record to 39 wins in 41 professional matches, twice he had to give in due to injury. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Challenger Johnson saw his first defeat in 24 fights. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In front of some 17,000 spectators in the Berne Arena, the 2.02-metre tall Klitchko aimed to dictate the match predominantly with his left hitting hand. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But the eleven centimetres shorter Johnson, how had announced the end of the Klitchko era before the fight, kept evading the hits from the world champion, meaning that Klitchko was not able to apply a decisive blow with his dangerous right hand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Overall, the passive Johnson did not do enough for a challenger and simply tried to survive the rounds. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Although he provoked Klitchko with words and gestures, his blows only rarely hit the world champion. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Nevertheless, he is only the second boxed since Timo Hoffmann in 2000 who fight the full twelve rounds against Klitchko. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The challenger had caused quite a stir in the Swiss capital before the fight. </seg>
<seg id="18"> He insulted Klitchko as &quot;an ugly zombie&quot;, who &quot;cannot do anything at all&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="19"> During weighing, the champion then allowed himself to be provoked to knock Johnson&apos;s sunglasses of his nose &quot;to be able to see into his eyes.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Fourth victory after Klitchko&apos;s return </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Klitchko came out on top in his fourth fight since his comeback on 11 October 2008. </seg>
<seg id="22"> After a sabbatical nearly four years, he beat the Nigerian Samuel Peter in Berlin and regained &quot;his&quot; WBC belt, which he had been forced to hand over before without a fight. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This year he then beat in the defence of his title the Cuban Juan Carlos Gomez from and Chris Arreola from the US in September. </seg>
<seg id="24"> I only took one blow in this fight, and am physically in very good shape, Klitchko said after the quick return to the ring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> His dream, however, remains the unification of all important titles in his family. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Brother Vladimir is world champion of the WBO and IBF associations. </seg>
<seg id="27"> But the WBA belt is worn by Britan David Haye after he dethroned the 2.13-metre tall Nikolay Valuev in November. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Haye had previously cancelled in the summer a fight planned to take place in September against Vitali Klitchko. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Apparently, his promotion company is now already planning a fight against Klitchko at London&apos;s Wembley stadium. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The Kunduz case </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Frontal attack from the opposition: Green party head Jürgen Trittin calls defence minister Guttenberg a liar for providing false information on the Kunduz affair. </seg>
<seg id="3"> SPD and Left Party demanding a clarification from the Chancellor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Hamburg/Berlin - After the recent revelations regarding the air raid of Kunduz, the opposition has accused defence minister Karl-Theodor zu Guttenberg (CSU) of deliberate deception. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The minister apparently made &quot;knowingly false statements&quot; regarding the fatal bombing of two tank trailers in September, said Green party head Jürgen Trittin on Saturday in the ARD news programme Tagesschau. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This is generally referred to as lying. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The order to kill was given in defiance of the rules of the International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) for Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="8"> That is the substance of the report, which NATO had, which Mr. Guttenberg has read, said Trittin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On Friday it was revealed that the attack was not only about destroying the abducted tankers, but also to specifically kill two Taleban leaders. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The US air strike ordered by the German Kunduz commander Colonel Klein, up to 142 people were killed of injured, according to the NATO inquiry report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Greens, SPD and Left Party Linke called on Chancellor Angela Merkel (CDU) on Saturday to address parliament immediately and to clarify what Guttenberg really knew about the event. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Merkel must clarify whether a strategy of targeted killing is part of the federal government&apos;s Afghanistan policy, and whether the Chancellor&apos;s Office, German army and intelligence service have approved this new strategy, demanded Jürgen Trittin and his Greens colleague Renate Künast. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Government spokesman Ulrich Wilhelm rejected the criticism resolutely. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Chancellor&apos;s Office did not take any influence on specific missions of the German army in Afghanistan, he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> On Saturday, doubts over the presentation by the ministry of the background of the dismissal of Inspector General Wolfgang Schneiderhan and State Secretary Peter Wichert emerged. </seg>
<seg id="16"> According to information available to SPIEGEL, the two provided Guttenberg with correct and complete information on the background of the tanker trailer attack. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Officially, it was said that they had lied about the existence of the NATO reports and kept sensitive details from the minister. </seg>
<seg id="18"> From the entourage of the top official, however, it was said that the defence ministry had even been directed to several reports, including a two-page documents of the commanding colonel Klein and a report from the military police. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In the meantime, Wichert is supposed to have asked for clarification in a letter, reports the Frankfurter Allgemeine Sonntagszeitung. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He has not received a response, it is claimed. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The ministry did not comment on the accusations on Saturday and referred to the fact that this would be clarified by the inquiry committee of parliament, which would be set up next Wednesday. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Dream worlds </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Some see images and hear voices when they are awake which others do not hear or see. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Not only in the mentally sick and during intoxication with drugs do the borders between imagination and reality become blurred. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As long as this happens in sleep, things are fine. </seg>
<seg id="5"> When we are in dark rooms with our eyes closed, we can surrender to the wildest imaginations and fantasies without restraint. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But anybody experiencing dream-like conditions or seeing and hearing things other people do not when they are awake, is regarded in contemporary Western society as a madman or drug addict, or strange at the very least. </seg>
<seg id="7"> But such images and voices are formed not only in the mentally sick or during drug intoxication. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> This is down to our imagination: The same neural processes which allow us to design houses, draw paintings or write novels can make the borders between dream, madness and reality become blurred. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Conscious conditions which are warped like dreams can occur in the most different forms, in the best case we call them visions, in the worst case madness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Even if their triggers and effects may differ, the visions of mystic Hildegard von Bingen, the drug experiences of New Age prophet Carlos Castaneda, shaman detachment from reality conditions, psychoses and hallucinations can be traced back to similar processes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Hallucination or delusions occur when the balance of the neural transmitters of the brain - predominantly dopamine noradrenaline, serotonin and acetylcholine - derails and the interaction of different brain segments is dysfunctional. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Complex hallucinations and delusional thoughts often occur during schizophrenic psychoses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Gravity no longer has any power over him </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The connection between madness and dream has occupied philosophers and doctors since ancient times. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Aristotle understood hallucinations to be a form of dream while awake, Wilhelm Griesinger, a founder of modern psychiatry, detected in 1861 a &quot;huge similarity of madness and dreamlike conditions&quot;, for Sigmund Freud dreams were even &quot;a psychosis, with all puzzles, delusions and misperceptions of such&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It is autumn 2001 when Henning T. turns into a comic figure. </seg>
<seg id="17"> His body is two-dimensional and excessively gaudy. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Gravity no longer has any power over him, he floats at the ceiling of the room. </seg>
<seg id="19"> He feels a kick. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Behind him are winged devilish figures with red, distorted faces, snarling. </seg>
<seg id="21"> They hunt him, kick him with heavy, flaming boots, throw him against walls, he feels the pain all over his body. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Loud, evil voices emerge from the walls and radio. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He can no longer stand them, the voices that abuse and insult him. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Henning T. pulls two cables out of the stereo system, ties them to a knot and attaches it to a hook on the ceiling. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He climbs on a speaker and puts the noose around his neck. </seg>
<seg id="26"> He jumps. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The noose becomes loose. </seg>
<seg id="28"> Let that be a lesson to you, the voices scream in an eardrum-tearing choir, &quot;go to the clinic and get treated!&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Today, Henning T. is 40 years old, he has had six acute psychoses, the last one is two years back, the first nearly 20 years ago. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It was caused by LSD. </seg>
<seg id="31"> His diagnosis is a schizoaffective-paranoid psychosis, he is also a manic-depressive, he takes drugs against depression, the mania and schizophrenia. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He has learned to live with his illness, he has been married for three years. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In psychosis I experienced the worst fear and deepest desperation, he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The illusions are a brutal reality </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> About 1 per cent of the population suffers at least once in their lifetime from schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics, it is treated with a frequency only second to depression. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In an acute schizophrenic psychosis, people affected can no longer distinguish between internal and external world, they reach an overexcited condition which can result in hallucinations, megalomania, paranoia or persecution mania. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> Particularly common is the hearing of voices - voices which command, comment or involve in dialogue. </seg>
<seg id="38"> Visual hallucinations are also not rare. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The affected person can no longer distinguish important things from unimportant things, the brain can no longer filter out disturbing signals, the conscious is flooded by impressions. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Like dreams, a psychosis also opens the floodgates on a flood of ideas and phantasies, which stem from the deeper levels of the conscious. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The perception of reality in a psychosis is subject-centred, says professor Thomas Fuchs, senior physician at the Clinic for General Psychiatry at the University Clinic of Heidelberg. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Schizophrenic patients are at the heart of the events, the meaning of everything is directed to him. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time, he finds himself in a passive role, he is, like in a dream, overwhelmed by the events can cannot affect them actively. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Schizophrenic patients therefore often feel threatened, controlled and manipulated. </seg>
<seg id="45"> A reality comparison is often not available to them, the illusions are a brutal reality, waking up is not possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> To experience a hallucination once in your life </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Contrary to dreams, says Fuchs, &quot;the sensual and spatial structure of reality, as perceived during a psychosis, remains intact as a rule&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The delusional thoughts and hallucinations are based in reality, the distortion of the events takes place within a framework of reality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Precisely why our brain plays such tricks on us, is still puzzling to scientists. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Extraordinary conditions can cause any person to lose his sense of reality for a short period of time, says Fuchs. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But not everybody will develop a psychosis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> There seems to be a genetic tendency to schizophrenia, but studies of twins have shown that genes are not the sole factor. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Scientists assume that patients have minimal brain damage. </seg>
<seg id="54"> We think that the neuronal maturing of the brain is disturbed in an early stage of development, through a virus infection in the mother during pregnancy, for instance, explains Fuchs. </seg>
<seg id="55"> But it remains a mystery how disturbances to the neuronal system comes about which also do not become manifest for many years initially. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> Environmental impacts also play a part - stress or traumatic experiences can trigger psychoses if the disposition is given. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Hallucinogen drugs can trigger psychoses, as they interfere with the transmitter system. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> When our brain runs hot </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The mad thing is that psychotics suffer from their hallucinations and take expensive medication to get rid of them, others spend money on drugs to get the same, says Lübeck-based psychology professor Erich Kasten. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Whether these illusions are perceived to be pleasant or unpleasant is often only a matter of perspective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> Kasten has been collecting reports for ten years on hallucinations and delusions; last year he assessed his results in a book titled The unreal World in our Head. </seg>
<seg id="62"> Hallucinations are a typical by-product of psychoses, but also of a remarkably large amount of other diseases. </seg>
<seg id="63"> These include, on top of mental illnesses such as borderline or depression, also often diseases such as migraine, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis or Alzheimer&apos;s disease and traumatic brain injuries. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Surprisingly, even the brain of healthy people hallucinates under certain conditions. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Hallucinations, says Kasten, consist of memory fragments, which are often held back. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66"> They occur when areas of the brain, where sensory perceptions are processed, are overactive or not sufficiently restrained; when our brain runs hot and also when there is a lack of stimulation. </seg>
<seg id="67"> Drugs can trigger this condition as much as brain damage or a psychosis. </seg>
<seg id="68"> But sensory deprivation, stress, lovesickness or other mental exceptional conditions too. </seg>
<seg id="69"> In more recent studies, up to one third of respondents claimed to have experienced a hallucination at least once in their lives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> In summer 2005 Sarah K. is 16 years old, she is living in a small town in Mecklenburg-Vorpommern and goes to the local secondary school. </seg>
<seg id="71"> Indeed, a perfectly normal girl. </seg>
<seg id="72"> It it were not for the images and voices. </seg>
<seg id="73"> During breaks, it can happen that a lanky boy with long dark hair approaches her. </seg>
<seg id="74"> When she answers him, her schoolmates look at her in surprise - nobody else sees or hears this boy. </seg>
<seg id="75"> They think the girls is a nutty daydreamer, but Sarah K. is not dreaming, she knows that much. </seg>
<seg id="76"> She is awake, she sees and hears this boy, just like she sees and hears the girl at the desk next to her. </seg>
<seg id="77"> She can even feel his presence, at least for some moments. </seg>
<seg id="78"> A pleasant feeling it is, she likes the boy. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Am I mad? she sometimes asks. </seg>
<seg id="80"> But she knows that this boy and the other illusions are not real and disappear again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> At night the appearances are usually frightening </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82"> The illusions are often a strain. </seg>
<seg id="83"> When she is sitting in the classroom, she sometimes cannot follow because the teacher is to her eyes and ears just introducing a new schoolmate, while she is explaining mathematical equations on the blackboard for everyone else. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> At night the appearances are usually frightening. </seg>
<seg id="85"> When she is waiting for sleep in her dark room, which comes far too rarely and late, she often cannot distinguish whether she is awake or already dreaming, whether the images she sees, the grimaces or the girl with the bleeding cuts on her arms and legs is standing in front of her open or closed eyes. </seg>

<seg id="87"> She does not tell her parents or friends anything about this, they would think she was mad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88"> Autumn 2009. Sarah K. is 20 years old now. </seg>
<seg id="89"> She passed her A levels last year and is now living with her boyfriend. </seg>
<seg id="90"> A year ago the hallucinations stopped. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Since she contacted psychologist Kasten via the internet, she knows exactly that she is not mad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="92"> Madness is also work of art born out of desperation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> If someone is socially isolated or suffers from sensory deprivation, he will very probably suffer from hallucinations after some time, says Kasten. </seg>
<seg id="94"> I assume that the brain is not busy enough and creates its own entertainment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95"> Sarah K., a single child, was afraid of other children when she was small; she often played alone. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Her hallucinations started when she learned at the age of 13 that the man she called dad since she could think was not her natural father. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> As during visual and acoustic hallucinations those areas of the brain become active which also process real impressions and sounds, it is often difficult for patients like Sarah K. to distinguish between illusions and reality. &quot;Every experience,&quot; says Kasten, &quot;takes place in the brain, reality is reproduced there. </seg>
<seg id="98"> Hallucinations are also images, which the brain creates, this is why they seem so real.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="99"> Illusions at night are also classified by Kasten as a form of hallucination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100"> The hallucinations of the healthy are not fundamentally different from those during an acute psychosis. </seg>
<seg id="101"> Contrary to schizophrene patients, mentally healthy people are able to identify illusions as unreal. </seg>
<seg id="102"> Kasten therefore advises his patients to appreciate hallucinations as a special ability. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103"> Border between dream and hallucination </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104"> In our far too conscious-centred world, imaginary experiencing is often unfortunately pathologised, says Michael Schmidt-Degenhard, professor in Heidelberg and senior physician of the Clinic for Psychiatry and Psychotherapy of the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf. </seg>
<seg id="105"> A psychosis is a severe, painful illness, but it also brings positive aspects, creativity - madness is also a work of art born out of desperation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> Schmidt-Degenhard has researched the so-called oneiroid experience, a particular form of conscious conditions which are warped like dreams. </seg>
<seg id="107"> Oneiroids are highly complex, detailed quasi dreams, which the person experiencing them believes are real and which he later cannot distinguish from being awake. </seg>
<seg id="108"> The oneiroid condition occurs in trauma- or sickness-related extreme situations, for instance in polyradiculitis patients, who experience a motor paralysis in full consciousness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109"> If a person is threatened by self- or world loss, for instance due to persistent, complete loss of mobility, he replaces the life-threatening real situation with an own, imaginary world, which is uncoupled from reality, says Schmidt-Degenhard. </seg>
<seg id="110"> A kind of border between dream and hallucination </seg>
<seg id="111"> As the mastering of a situation is not possible in reality, a change of world takes place, but the real situation is not updated in the imagination. </seg>
<seg id="112"> An intense form of creating and applying meaning in an unbearable situation, which allows us people our own ability to design and not go under in the emptiness of a loss of consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Everything is real, even later in the memory </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114"> The Zurich-based art historian Peter Cornelius Claussen also describes his oneiroid experiences in his book A Change of Heart as the sole&apos;s attempt to safe itself. </seg>
<seg id="115"> He is 49 years old when his consciousness takes off on journeys for days after heart valve surgery with subsequent heart transplantation while his body is damned to immobility in the intensive care unit. </seg>
<seg id="116"> Claussen delves into a world of his creation, visits foreign places and times: He experiences himself as a bedridden, old man, on board a train sanatorium, a robot watching over his health. </seg>
<seg id="117"> He lives in the early Middle Ages amongst noblemen who make intoxicants from blood. </seg>
<seg id="118"> He is abducted by a Greek man on his motorbike to his homeland, surfs with his hospital bed in the spring snow of the Alps and meets a Korean member of the mafia. </seg>
<seg id="119"> He is fully taken up with the imaginary events; everything is real, even later in his memory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> These inner trips, Claussen believes, are fundamentally different from every dream. </seg>
<seg id="121"> Dream is a different condition, he describes his experience. </seg>
<seg id="122"> Contrary to that, the memories from mental trips are overtly clear to me even after years and in minute detail. </seg>
<seg id="123"> Even clearer and more intense that real events. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> The intensity of this experience breaks the horizon of our day-to-day experiences, says psychiatrist Schmidt-Degenhard. </seg>
<seg id="125"> Ultimately, oneiroids, psychoses, hallucinations and drug intoxication show how fragile our images of the external reality are, even when awake. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="126"> Every change to the conscious, summarises psychologist Kasten, &quot;can result in a warping of what we call reality&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="127"> An experience which can indeed be enriching. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Children set to take over the publishing house at the age of 27 </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Kallen, the new head of the publishing house, is an interim solution: In the long term, Hubert Burda wants his company to be taken over by his two children, he has told the SPIEGEL magazine. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The holding is to remain to 100% in the family. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Hamburg - The publisher Hubert Burda sees the long-term future of his company in his children&apos;s hands. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Both children will inherit at the age of 27 and are strongly intent on joining the company, the 69-year-old has told the SPIEGEL magazine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The details have already been organised as a precaution. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The question whether they will be active in the company will only arise later. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Also the question whether they are able to do so. </seg>
<seg id="11"> One cannot put one&apos;s children in charge of 7,500 employees if they are not capable of this. </seg>
<seg id="12"> That will kill the children, and the company with them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> On Thursday, Burda announced that he would be resigning from his post as chairman as of January and appointed Paul-Bernhard Kallen as his successor. </seg>
<seg id="14"> 52-year-old Kallen has been a member of the board at Burda since 1999. </seg>
<seg id="15"> He was initially responsible for technology. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Later, with the Treasury department, he assumed responsibility for the company assets, and after Jürgen Todenhöfer&apos;s departure, also for direct marketing, foreign operations, print and finances. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> For the first time, a person who is not a family member is thus at the helm of the publishing house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Burda&apos;s children are 19 and 17; his son Felix, who would be 42 today, died a couple of years ago. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The appointment of Kallen is designed to &quot;bridge 10, 15 years&quot;, says Burda. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The holding is to remain to 100 per cent in family ownership, said Burda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In light of the cases of Schickedanz and Schaeffler, Burda stated that family-owned companies are not safe from going under either: &quot;That always affected families who were infected with a capital addiction, who speculated wrongly and through they could advance to become a really big player. </seg>
<seg id="22"> That never was my strategy. </seg>
<seg id="23"> He never had &quot;dreams of world power&quot;, says Burda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> I do not see myself as a political preceptor of the country, as Springer was, and I do not want to participate in the world league with Time magazine, these companies have become too big. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The promise of FonPeek </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Peek is extremely limited, a device that&apos;s only used for checking email, without no feature for viewing certain kinds of attachments or surfing the web. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It enjoyed its 5 minutes of fame in the U.S. when Times Magazine named it one of the products of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Seeing it on the street is more difficult, to be honest, but the idea can be interesting, especially for children. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Unlike smartphones, the Peek is very cheap and has a very low monthly fee, less than half, for example, of the iPhone&apos;s data plan. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Given its success, the company has released two new devices: one exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free data service for life in exchange for paying six times more for the Peek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> FonPeek, presented at the La Web event yesterday, is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is just as limited as its U.S. counterpart, but comes with a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The monthly service price, around 12 euros a month, includes roaming throughout Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Those who travel with a smartphone already know what it&apos;s like to have to give up data when they cross the border or desperately search for a cafe with WiFi (or a Fon connection)to check their mail. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The idea of fixed-price roaming is incredibly attractive and long awaited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Yes, some operators have special arrangements and travel plans, but in my experience it takes a doctorate in physics to understand them and good glasses to read the fine print. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The repeated twisting of the European Commission&apos;s arm to get affordable roaming rates across Europe has had almost no noticeable effect. </seg>
<seg id="14"> There&apos;s a fear of using data outside one&apos;s home country, and rightly so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> For a gadget like the FonPeek (it no longer seems strange that it is called Fon since it lacks WiFi) to get this kind of fee, it means that the operators are starting the think differently and study different means of recouping the cost of their data networks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Kindle is another good example, including a book downloading feature and other internet queries. </seg>
<seg id="17"> No contracts, no bother. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It&apos;s a connected device and is paid for when it&apos;s purchased, not month by month. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And that is what I hope to see one day with FonPeek, a call option with life-time access, which the Peek already has in the U.S. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Not because I&apos;m going to buy it. </seg>
<seg id="21"> I check my mail on my phone, thank you. </seg>
<seg id="22"> I hope so because I think it&apos;s an unfair model for the consumer. </seg>
<seg id="23"> It would be interesting to see a computer with the same system. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yellow is, without a doubt, the U.S. First Lady&apos;s favorite color. </seg>
<seg id="3"> She already attended Barak Obama&apos;s inauguration as U.S. president in a yellow dress and coat; she chose the same to accompany him to what was undoubtedly the second most important moment of his life: the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony in Oslo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Michelle Obama wore a very similar dress on both occasions:apart from being a similar yellow-green color with bright highlights-, both times the outfit consisted of three pieces, a dress, jacket and coat of the same material, and was adorned with a large embroidery or necklace. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="1"> 75% of working mothers have had work problems during maternity. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Discrimination at work has increased in recent years, especially for women of younger generations who want to be mothers. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This has been revealed by a study entitled &apos;Fertility and work history of women in Spain&apos;, developed by the CSIC in collaboration with the Women&apos;s Institute. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The survey of 9,737 women from 15 to 75 years old leaves no doubt about it: 75% of working mothers have seen their opportunities in the workplace limited due to maternity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The study notes that there are many differences in when couples start cohabiting, in the number of children, depending on whether they work or not and the type of work they do. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Those that don&apos;t have an activity outside of the home, work part time, or don&apos;t have a stable job start living with their partner sooner, expect their first child, and have more children. </seg>
<seg id="7"> By contrast, women with a stable job, especially in the public sector, put off cohabitation and motherhood and have fewer offspring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> &quot;Women between 35 and 49 years old with steady work have the first child, on average, 3.7 years after starting to live together,a figure which increases to 4.1; women with steady jobs need more time to achieve their lifelong goals, which has led them to postpone getting married and having children. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Additionally, the type of job held has a great influence over maternity, but less over the mating schedule,&quot; explains CSIC researcher, Margarita Delgado. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Level of education is another factor whichdifferentiates the age of women marrying and having their first child. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the survey, the higher the level of education, the older the age at which they get married and have their first child. </seg>
<seg id="12"> There was also a difference among women from the same generation. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For example, in a group of 35- to 49-year-olds, those who had elementary and those who and higher education had become mothers for the first time, on average, at 25.1 and 32.1 respectively. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Their level of education provides yet another division among women. </seg>
<seg id="15"> While those who have an elementary education marry and have their first child before finding a stable job, those who have secondary or higher levels of education reverse the sequence and give priority to securing a stable job as a precondition to marriage and having a child,&quot; Delgado specifies. </seg>

<seg id="7"> On Albert Camus: &quot;In his pages I discovered that the Mediterranean wasn&apos;t a sea, rather a spiritual instinct, almost physical, the same one I felt without giving it a name: the pleasure against the ill-fated, morality without guilt, and innocence without any god.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> On Samuel Beckett: &quot;Nihilistic, allegorical Christian, he wrote what was in his blood, not in his intellect, between impotence and ignorance, with a dazzling poetic humor, meaningless, like the blade of the knife that was about to kill him.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> On Graham Greene: &quot;Our man was abducted by this woman with a passion that lasted for thirteen years, in which flesh combined the excitement of adultery with the pleasure of remorse, a spiritual privilege which consisted of reaching heaven through the road of perdition.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> On James Joyce: &quot;&apos;Ulysses&apos; was published in Paris in 1922 by Sylvia Beach.This is one of the eight-thousand-meter peaks of world literature which must be scaled by the north face, which the best mountain climbers hurl themselves off time and time again.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> On William Faulkner: &quot;He was a weird guy.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="12"> Of himself, he sometimes said that he was the heir to a landowner in the county, and other times that he was the son of a black woman and a crocodile. </seg>
<seg id="13"> &quot;They were both dreams of grandeur.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> On Louis-Ferdinand Celine: &quot;This writer took the deranged scream cried from a bridge by that character from Munich in order to carry his eco, under his literary form, into the depths of the night of the 20th century, and made it a journey, hiding from himself and calling on the past with a violent discourse to the worms.&quot; </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Our indignation knew no bounds because we don&apos;t see the fun in gratuitous aggression towards a small and defenseless animal, which by the way, was on a leash. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It must be added that it distressed the woman who was calmly taking a walk and who, when she reprimanded those individuals, came to fear for her safety, because a lunatic who attacks an animal is capable of doing the same to a woman, a child, an elderly person, and, certainly, to anyone weaker than himself. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The tire manufacturer Michelin, in collaboration with the Spanish Foundation for Road Safety (Fesvial), has launched a campaign to promote the use of helmets, especially among younger motorists, both organizations reported today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This initiative aims to raise awareness of the importance of wearing a helmet, because it is the only means of protection capable of preventing head injuries and even death in the event of an accident while riding a motorcycle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Michelin indicated that this campaign is part of their commitment to road safety which &quot;goes beyond designing and manufacturing safer products every day,&quot; and added that it also contributes towards this goal by means of other educational and informative measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> This new campaign promoting helmet use in motorcycles, under the motto &apos;To be or not to be,&apos; will initially distribute posters to more than 500 motorcycle shops to spread the message as widely as possible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Finally, Michelin stressed that road safety &quot;is a constant concern&quot; for the company, as being a manufacturer of tires for two-wheeled vehicles, one of its main goals is to develop ever safer products. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Almost two years later, the light commercial vehicle market begins to see the light at the end of the tunnel. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The 9,425 vehicles registered in November in Spain represent a rise of 12.6% from 2008, and, more importantly, indicates the first increase after 22 consecutive months of decline, according to figures from the manufacturers association(ANFAC) and the vendors association (GANVAM). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> However, it&apos;s not time to start celebrating since the reference the comparison was made to -November 2008- was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease from the previous year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The outcome is that, regardless of last month&apos;s upturn, the total number of registrations during those 11 months is 40% below last year&apos;s. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Since January, 95,853 units of all the vehicle classes which make up the hotchpotch of light commercial vehicles were sold: derived vans, pick ups, vans, light vans and light-chassis trucks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the same time, the storm clouds affecting demand have not completely cleared, so even though they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small and medium-sized enterprises, almost all of which pay through external funding. </seg>
<seg id="8"> As a result of the restrictions caused by closed tap bank loans, it is necessary to add other factors like increasing unemployment and the persistent economic decline. </seg>

<seg id="9"> In light of this, unlike cars, the aid of the 2000Epurchase has done little. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Aside from individuals, provisions are made for the self-employed and SMEs that are going to purchase a light commercial vehicle of up to 3.5 tons with a CO2 emission level not exceeding 160 grams per kilometer, but the number of transactions has been insignificant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Just yesterday, the need for the Administration to devote special attention to these vehicles, and also to commercial verhicles (trucks and buses), was brought to mind by GANVAM. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Support systems to emergency brakes will have to be a mandatory feature in European cars, just as it happened with anti-lock breaks (ABS) and will happen with stability control (ESP) </seg>
<seg id="3"> In fact, they are already in all newly registered passenger cars and light commercial vehicles, while the rest have a grace period until the end of February 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The measure, imposed by the European Union, aims to increase pedestrian safety; however, how they work can also help prevent many rear-end collisions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> What the emergency brake assistant does is increase the pressure on the brakes in the event of an emergency, which the system detects through the driver&apos;s pressure on the pedal. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But this doesn&apos;t always maintain that pressure through to the end. </seg>
<seg id="7"> According to a study conducted by the car components manufacturer, Bosch, a third of drivers involved in an accident had not stepped on the brake before a collision and half of them didn&apos;t apply the full force. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Up to 1,100 accidents </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The intervention of the aid, however, calls for the full braking system, reducing the distance the car needs to stop. </seg>
<seg id="10"> According to an EU study, if all cars were equipped with this feature, 1,100 fatal accidents involving pedestrians could be avoided a year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The reduction will be even bigger -it estimates that one in four accidents injuring people would be avoided - when the so-called smart emergency braking systems become popular. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> In this case, the vehicle is equipped with a system which (via radar or a camera) detects obstacles and warns the driver, in addition to lightly applying the brakes. </seg>
<seg id="13"> If the driver reacts, he helps it by increasing the pressure on the pedal if it is necessary. </seg>
<seg id="14"> If he does not react, and even though the collision is unavoidable, the device exerts the maximum force to the brakes to minimize damage. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> While workers at the Opel plant in Figueruelas (Zaragoza) have already been informed by Nick Reilly, the new president of General Motors (GM) Europe, that the production of the new Meriva will begin in the first week of April -probably the 8th- as reported by Javier Ortega, the U.S. manufacturer is cautioning that more time is needed to conclude the recovery plan for Opel. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Nick Reilly, the new president of GM Europe, wants each of the points of the new plan to have the prior approval of the affected party. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And this may make the final document, which will be submitted first to the workers and then to the governments of the countries where there are factories, be delayed until the beginning of 2010. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On the other hand, GM is making sure that a decision regarding the sale of Saab should be made in the next few days. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is not strange that the Swedish government has increased the pressure on the U.S. manufacturer to make a decision as soon as possible. </seg>
<seg id="7"> GM admits to having had contact with some potential new buyers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> One of them could be Geely, which aims to acquire Volvo, but the option of the Dutch sports car manufacturer Skyper, which is funded by the Russian group Converg, is gaining momentum. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In the event that none of them come to an agreement, GM would be able to sell some Saab assets to the Chinese Baic. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Driving the Porsche Boxster Spyder </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> To develop their latest and most precious gem, the Porsche engineers took the Boxster S as a base and succeeded in trimming it by no less than 80 kilos,making the total weight a mere 1,275 kilos. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This led them to, first, cutting out the automatic roof, which has been substituted by a manually-operated canvas one, saving 21 kilos; using aluminum doors, like those on the GT3, &apos;dropping&apos; another 15, removing the climate control, 13; reducing the gas tank from 64 to 54 liters, earning 7 more kilos ; mounting sporty bucket seats, another 12, and with the 19-inch lightweight wheels, five. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Finally, foregoing the CDR-30 sound system brought it down another 6 kilograms, and changing the door handles to fabric ones cut the remaining kilo. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Even though it is also available with the PDK dual-clutch shift, the test was conducted on a unit with the six-speed manual transmission, mainly on the back roads of California and along stretches of really windy mountain roads. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Its performance can only be described as flawless. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The reduction in weight does not imply that the car doesn&apos;t grip the asphalt. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Rather the complete opposite: it has been some time since we tested a model so small and light, which, in turn, transmitted so much confidence when cornering, even at high speeds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is a small athlete, able to warm up its muscles in a low gear for as long as we need, until ordered to sprint, to brake, to recover and go back to exploiting its engine... </seg>
<seg id="10"> Just what we asked for. Thanks to its steering, as communicative as it is precise, what we tell it with our hands on the wheel is what the car will do. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And it will do it with surgical precision. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Optional engine noise </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The sound of its V6 boxer with 320 horse power (10 more than the Boxster S) is well made and can be enhancedwith the &apos;sport&apos; option and through a system that modifies the roar of the engine, which debuted earlier in the Panamera. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The acceleration is brutal, either from a standstill or recovering. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The suspension is firm but not harsh or uncomfortable. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The asphalt of the highways we crossed with the Boxster Spyder was fairly beaten up, but the car handled the potholes well. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The electronic aids hardly showed up on the course; that is because, well into the morning, we found early morning ice and gravel on some curves. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In short, it is an ultra lightweight car, one of the most fun to drive on the market, andis a bit more than just a simple modification of the Boxster S. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The car will go on sale in February 2010, priced at 70,931 euros. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Baskonia gives away a victory in Israel </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Caja Laboral achieved a stunning 82-91 victory on their visit to the Maccabee Electra court despite Dusko Ivanovic&apos;s team&apos;s heavy losses, and after the great performance by Mizra Teltovic, who was the best on his team with eight three-pointers scored (29 points), they now at the top of their group. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The Vitorian team knew to make up for the significant absences of Herrmann, Oleson, Huertas and Micov with a big dose of involvement and team work, even though it had to hold out until the end to take the victory. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Additionally, their huge success from the sidelines, with 16 three pointers scored, had a lot to do with the final triumph. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The game started out in favor of the Azulgranas, who put themselves ahead on the scoreboard from the start. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As Vitora&apos;s first four baskets were from the perimeter, the speculation was already that they had jumped into the Israeli net with hot wrists. </seg>
<seg id="7"> English and Teletovic were the main scorers of the 18-20 at the end of the first period. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The second quarter was more of the same, but the Alavan team opted for the inside game of Barac and the work of Eliyahu, who was greeted with whistles and applause at his return home, to continue increasing their lead by half-time (34-43). </seg>
<seg id="9"> Teletovic had already begun to stand out as the best on his team with 13 points, even though Splitter&apos;s &quot;six fewer&quot; points already signaled that it wasn&apos;t going to be the best night for the Brazilian. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But the game, despite being headed for half time, was not more decidedand the Maccabees tried to remind the Vitorians that not just anybody wins on their court, and with the &apos;hand of Elias&apos; putting the pressure on, they managed to get involved in the game. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Eidson and Pnini played a decisive role in the &quot;yellows&apos;&quot; return to the light. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> More disadvantages </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Ivanovic&apos;s players, injured but far from dead, needed to run a couple of plays correctly before they could breathe, and that&apos;s when the machine gun Marza Teletovic arrived, with three almost consecutive three-pointers and the help of English and Ribas, he brought the scoreboard back to a reassuring lead (54-67), which the home team managed to narrow down at the end of the third quarter (57-67). </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Alavas worked themselves to the bone in the last period, and English and San Emeterio (65-75) had already made it clear that they were not going to let anyone take away what they had earned during the first thirty minutes. </seg>
<seg id="15"> However, Pnini and Eidson, the best on their team, did not give up and tried to keep their team alive from the three-point line (70-77). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In spite of this, and with Splitter fouling out, Ivonic&apos;s team didn&apos;t rush, defended well, and, even though the Israelis came close at the last minute, the game ws already won and victory escaped Tel Aviv for the first time in the season. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Unicaja lost miserably in Greece against the Olympiacos and gave them the lead in Group B of the Euroleague in a game marked by the loss of the cajistas, especially in the inside game (Freeland, Lima and Archibald) which facilitated the Greek victory. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Malaga team was not cowed by the atmosphere in the Peace and Friendship Stadium, nor by the excellence of its rival, maybe the most powerful in Europe and with a big budget. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The playing exhibited in the first quarter allowed the Andalusians to take it easy.An aggressive defense and three consecutive three-pointers, two from the point guard Omar Cook, and one from Guillem Gubio, baffled the home team 12-18, minute 9. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Olympiacos were obviously surprised by Unicaja&apos;s intensity, even though the home team&apos;s arsenal in the inside game with Bourousis, Vujcic and Schortsanitis brought them back to 22-20, in the 13th minute, at which point an attempted fight between the two U.S. point guards, Beverley and Williams, resulted in the disqualification of both players. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Greek team started showing their superiority inside both zones, where the loss of English center Joel Freeland to injury and three personal fouls by Carlos Jimenez hampered the cajistas. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Between them the inside players and the Lithuanian forward, Linas Leizas, with their three-pointers, increased the lead to 44-32 in the 19th minute. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> An impossible comeback </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The third period was very offensive for the Olympiacos, who, despite 19 losses, proved superior and began to even out the difference in the game in Malaga, making it 66-48 in the 27th minute, which shook the group leader. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Unicaja tried to overcome their absences and the latest withdrawal of the Scottish center, Robert Archibald, who was injured during the game. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Despite all the problems, because of Cook&apos;s control and three-pointers, and Lewis&apos; assists, Unicaja had some hope left with the score at 66-57 in the 31st minute. </seg>
<seg id="12"> But it was practically impossible because the Olympiacos, when pressed and given their superiority, seemed unstoppable once centimeters inside the zone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The Croatian center, Nikola Vujcic, managed to bring back the basket average to 81-62 in the 37th minute and Unicaja gave up, handing the top-seed over to the Olympiacos. </seg>

<seg id="2"> After days of wine and roses from last spring, when inflation was the prevailing trend on the markets, uncertainty again rears its ugly head, which is not surprising since it is their natural state, in an environment in which agents make decisions about the naturally uncertain future. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The cure prescribed by the central banks to stabilize the markets was to monetize debt with the direct purchase of assets and indirectly give an open bar liquidity at close-to-zero rates so that the financial institutions would buy deductible assets. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The central banks have already confirmed that direct purchases of assets have practically ended and, without questioning their unorthodox liquidity policy, are beginning to throw a spanner in the works as the ECB makes its yearly auction next week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Therefore, investors doubt the ability of the global economy to sustain economic recovery without such unorthodox measures, and we are seeing a reversal of the reduction in risk premiums. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The volatility of the stock markets and the corporate bond spreads have swiftly picked up again, even though they are far behind the extreme levels that they reached at the beginning of the year. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The states were obligated to socialize private risk, and again public debt is going to be affected. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Again there is a flight for quality and the U.S., Japan and Germany have been the refuge of choice for investors, causing awider spread of the Eurozone countries in respect to Germany. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Spain hardly seems to have been affected by this period of instability, but that&apos;s when Standard and Poor&apos;s arrived and threatened a new revision, downgrading the Kingdom of Spain. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Furthermore, some uncertainty doesn&apos;t hurt to silence defenders of moral hazard, who again tried to raise awareness of those responsible for the global economic policy by having stopped the destructive effects derived from credit restrictions on the loss of jobs, when what should be done is to declare a new Thanksgiving Day. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> However, Dubai&apos;s paints with a tribal fight between the emirs to restore power in the emirates,and we&apos;ve already seen it before in Greece. </seg>
<seg id="12"> A Government which hides the public deficit, elections and a new Government that pulls up the rug. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Prodi did it in Italy after Berlusconi, and Socrates in Portugal after Barroso. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It doesn&apos;t make sense that Ecofin saved Hungry from a breach of its external payments at the beginning of the year, and thatit is going to let a euro member-country fail to fulfill its commitments. </seg>
<seg id="15"> What is logical is that Ecofin has forced the Greek government to be transparent, and make its citizens jointly responsible for the need for extraordinary measures to maintain the stability of its public finances. </seg>
<seg id="16"> If, as we hope, we find ourselves before a standardized period of transient risk premiums, after some excess of leveraged positions, it would be within our expectations. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the case of Spain, since our public debt is spreading like the European corporate bonds, we should not be worried. </seg>
<seg id="18"> If the European spreads decrease and ours continue to expand, then it would be an idiosyncratic risk for Spain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> That of Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s is an anecdote. When our leading indicators are forcing the majority of research services to anticipate its recovery scenarios and to revise up its scenario for 2011, including the OECD and the European Commission, they return to the fray with a Japanese scenario for the Spanish economy,and long life expectancy does not portend its warning. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> For the president of Iberdrola, Spain needs to invest 50 billion euros by 2020 and another 60 billion between that date and 2030, while they keep operating the nuclear power plants which are presently open. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Otherwise, the investments required will not be 60 billion, but up to 95 billion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Yes, Iberdrola believes that in the next decade investments should not be spent on increasing its generating capacity, but on distribution networks and on international interconnections. </seg>
<seg id="7"> From 2020 on, the matter changes and the power will have to increase. </seg>
<seg id="8"> His bet is in both coal plants withcarbon dioxide catchers and, especially, renewable sources of energy. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In this case, he considers that it takes 18,000 new MW, and that is with &quot;support energy.&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Though he believes that the Sustainable Economy Act, which the government has just approved, is in line with what his company has been calling for, Galan would not draw blood with a royal decree to promote the consumption of domestic coal, which contradicts the policies to combat climate change. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In his opinion, there is &quot;a clear, long-term gamble&quot; in this sense, despite the &quot;sure&quot; measures, as the Chairman of Iberdrola calls them. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> As it is, Galan believes that the decisions to invest, even though they are long-term, should start to be made since it has already taken a long time to think them through, and a stable framework for addressing remuneration is necessary. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Winning the UEFA Champions League doesn&apos;t just earn you glory.It is also a major source of income for the big clubs. </seg>
<seg id="7"> So much so that UEFA figures show that the competition has dealt out 5,362.5 million euros to the 105 teams (12 of them from Spain) who have participated in the event since the tournament was founded in the 1992/1993 season. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Real Madrid and F.C. Barcelona have fared well in this distribution. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The white club has been the third on the continent to have pocketed more money from participating, and the only one, after AC Milan, to have won the trophy three times. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Catalan team, the defending champion and last winner of the defunct European Cup in 1992, is fifth in the rankings. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Much, two teams that have also made more money by participating in the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And that is in spite of both of them losing against Barcelona. </seg>
<seg id="13"> What more, Spain is only the third country to have made more money through the Champions League despite having earned more titles than any other country (five, compared to Italy&apos;s four, England&apos;s three, and Germany&apos;s two). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Distribution </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> This apparent paradox is explained by the complicated payment system the UEFA uses. </seg>
<seg id="16"> For this fiscal year the body chaired by Michel Platini expects to collect 1.090 billion for the Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The UEFA dedicates 413.1 million of that money to pay fixed rates: each of the 20 clubs participating in the prequalifying round (including Atletico Madrid) receives 2.1 million. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Additionally, those who managed to participate received 3.8 million just for being there, in addition to another 550,000 euros for every game they play. </seg>
<seg id="19"> There are also bonuses for winning (800,000 euros) and for ties (400,000 for each team).The octa-finalists receive three million each; the eight quarterfinalists, 3.3 million. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The last four will pocket 4 million each. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The champion will win 9 million, versus the 5.2 million for the runner-up. </seg>
<seg id="22"> So, with the idea of the fixed rates, a club takes home at least 7.1 million, and at most 31.2 million. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Barcelona on the other hand pocketed 2.5 million for winning the European Super Cup in August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But there are other varying payments to which 337.8 million are allocated. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This money is distributed according to the proportionate value of each television market. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Spain is the leader with four places allocated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Last year&apos;s champion got 40% of the allocated money, 30% for second place, 20% for third, 10% for fourth. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The other part will be paid according to the number of games played this year. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Nueva Rumasa offers 61 million euros for 29.9% of Sos </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Yesterday, the Nueva Rumasa holding company sifted through the details of the bid on shares which led to the acquisition of a stake of between 25% and 29.9% in Sos. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is a percentage which doesn&apos;t require them to launch a takeover bid (OPA) for all of the securities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Specifically, Nueva Rumasa is offering 1.5025 eurosper share, to be distributed over 10 years, and with a 1% annual interest rate. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Sos shares closed yesterday at 1.85 euros; so, Nueva Rumasa&apos;s offer undervalued the company 18% below the market value. </seg>
<seg id="6"> According to Nueva Rumasa, the price of 1.50 euros reflects the real value of Sos. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The offer is subject to the decision of eight of the 15 advisers. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Jerezano group is giving a period of 15 days for shareholders to express their interest in selling securities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The CNMV assured that it had not been informed of the offer, despite Ruiz Mateos&apos; company saying that it had contacted a regulator. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If this comes to fruition, the payout would reach 611.7 million when the capitalization of Sos is at 254.27 million. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Meanwhile, Sos is restructuring its management. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In an attempt to stay out of possible takeover bids and the legal vagaries of its former managers, the brothers Jesus and Jaime Salazar, it announced the election of Maria Luisa Jordana as the director of the internal audit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a decision which makes her the first woman to hold a senior position in the food company. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This is a newly created position which reports directly to the president of the group. </seg>
<seg id="15"> And not without controversy, as the company is still immersed in the legal battle for the alleged diversion of over 230 million from Sos to the Salazar brothers&apos; holding company. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In fact, it&apos;s possible that Sos will reveal further diversions of funds in the next few months. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In regards to the Salazars&apos; credit, the former advisers Ildefonso Ortega and Angel Fernandez Noriega (representatives of CCM and Unicaja) testified and affirmed that they approved of the diversion of 212 million without knowing where the money was going. </seg>

<seg id="1"> New tools for inspecting cars </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In these days of storms and accidents, it is not only garages that are making a profit. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Every day, thousands of cars that have been in accidents are towed to a garage, where a technician must evaluate the damage and what the repair will cost. </seg>
<seg id="4"> No claim is the same, and calculating the cost of parts and labor can be a long and complicated task. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Manually calculating the cost of a repair between 20,000 and 30,000 euros, including parts and labor, may take two or three hours. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> However, with the help of the most recent computer tools, it would take a matter of minutes. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This is why almost 100% of technicians are using this kind of system. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Providers of services, claims solutions, and maintenance are working to compile data supplied by manufacturers, and then process it and offer it to customers as a useful tool. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In Spain, Audatex, of the North American Groupo Solera, is the industry leader;80% of assessments are done using their products. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The other firms in the sector, competing in the field of data assessment and processing, are GtMotive and Eurotax. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Working with data supplied by manufacturers is far from simple. </seg>
<seg id="12"> According to Eduardo Velazquez, the Audatex business manager, 63 manufacturers and importers are working in Spain, and each of them submits data in a different format. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Furthermore, the amount of data to process is increasing to the point where they have released more versions, variants and engines in the last five years than in the previous 15. </seg>
<seg id="14"> When a new car hits the market, these companies get to work. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> It&apos;s very arduous work because you have to catalog each of the thousands of vehicle parts andenter in your price. </seg>
<seg id="16"> In addition, a &quot;smart&quot; graphic is made for each model, where you can &quot;click&quot; on different parts of the car. </seg>
<seg id="17"> If it is a mass-market model, the work can be ready in a week, provided the process goes quickly. </seg>
<seg id="18"> If it&apos;s an uncommon car, it can take up to three or four months.Currently, Audatex provides comprehensive data for 99.2% of the cars sold in Spain. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Among the most exclusive models, information is available for a Porsche, but not a Ferrari or Lamborghini for example. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As for the number of cars in circulation, it is over 99%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> In order to document and develop the databases, Audatex has eight centers scattered around the world (Spain, France, Germany, USA, Brazil, Mexico, China and Japan), and each of these specializes in a specific brand. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Its national headquarters is in Alcobendas (Madrid). </seg>
<seg id="23"> There, over a hundred technicians (usually expert mechanics) work with three computer screens at the same time. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Audatex invests 90 million euros a year in developing these databases. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Every month, 2.5 million pieces of information are added, and clients receive updates every two days. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Developing that huge flow of information lets them give these companies different applications and varied products. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> The most common use focuses on maintenance and repair, but depending on the country, there are also tools to manage scrap pieces and to calculate the market and residual value of a car. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The only company with a used car guide available in Spain is Eurotax. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Audatex doesn&apos;t offer one in our country, but it does in the United States. </seg>
<seg id="30"> In view of the products that Audatex offers, it is easy to get an idea of the kind of support available to professionals in this sector. </seg>
<seg id="31"> This company offers 10 different tools; AudaPlus, being the flagship product, is the standard solution, designed to allow technicians to assess claims. </seg>
<seg id="32"> It includes cars, motorcycles, and light and heavy industrial vehicles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Besides the cost of parts, it includes manufacturer estimates of repair times and paint charts. </seg>
<seg id="34"> This tool charges according to the use, for each appraisal. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The highest cost is 5.75 euros for customers who rarely use it, 10 times a month at most. </seg>
<seg id="36"> Then, every insurance company that makes thousands of assessments negotiates their price with Audatex. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Other products, like AudaVIN, facilitate the complete identification of a vehicle and the equipment that it left the assembly line with, just from its vehicle identification number. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> AudaGlass focuses on the glass parts of a car, and AudaSubastas is an on-line service open to the professional sector which facilitates the bidding on vehicles calssed as write-offs. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Their statistics service is very useful for identifying trends, geo-demographic analysis and knowing standard deviations of makes and models. </seg>
<seg id="40"> You can study, for example, how many models of a particular make have gone to a shop because of malfunctions or how many have been in serious accidents in a certain period. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Gt Motive is the only Spanish company working to develop these kinds of tools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> It sells, among others, the GT Estimate, which is again designed for technicians and also provides digital images, access to parts and the manufacturer&apos;s official prices and times. </seg>
<seg id="43"> GT Motive is a Grupo EINSA company, which was founded in 1971 as a provider of automotive services and solutions for assessing damage, malfunctions and maintenance. </seg>
<seg id="44"> The GT Appraisal Guide is its historical reference product on the market. </seg>
<seg id="45"> They work with 24,000 users in garages, 3,100 technicians and 53 insurance companies. </seg>
<seg id="46"> Its turnover has grown by 20% per year over the past three years, and it brought in 10.8 million euros in 2008. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Early last year, the globalization process started with the installation of an office in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Meanwhile, Audatex was founded in Germany in 1966 and set up shop in Spain in 1979. </seg>
<seg id="49"> According to company sources, 62% of its business is generated in Europe and the rest of the world, and the remaining 37% in North and South America.They work with more than 900 insurance companies and 33,000 shops, 3,000 of which are in Spain. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Grupo Solera&apos;s (Audatex, Sidexa, Informex ABZ, Hollander and IMS) worldwide turnover will total 557 million dollars, 3.3% more than 2008. </seg>
<seg id="51"> In our country, the company brought in 19.1 million euros, 7.2% more than last year. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In 2005, Grupo Solera was valued at 1 billion dollars on the stock exchange, and its shares are now listed for a total of 2.4 billion dollars. </seg>
<seg id="53"> It is been listed on the NYSE since 2007 and is included in Standard &amp; Poor&apos;s reference index. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> Damaged car on-line auctions </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> Last October, Grupo Solera bought Autoonline, an internet platform for selling cars, motorcycles, and especially damaged vehicles. </seg>
<seg id="56"> The endeavor entailed an outlay of 59.5 million euros for 85% of the company&apos;s capital, which would increase in the upcoming year by the remaining 15%. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The aim of the acquisition was to offer more value-added services to its customers, with the possibility of reaching an immense international market. </seg>
<seg id="58"> This appraisal and buying and selling service is directed exclusively at professionals in the sector, such as insurance companies, technicians, renting agencies, shops, scrap yards, and professional sellers who must register before using it. </seg>
<seg id="59"> This platform was created in Germany in 1996, and it manages more than 650,000 transactions throughout Europe, 500,000 of them in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="60"> Its major markets include Spain, Greece, Poland and Turkey. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The site currently has more than 1,500 registered sellers and 4,000 technicians. </seg>
<seg id="62"> It oversees 3,000 listings a day, and around 100 new listings are added every day on the Spanish market. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Under Spanish law, a car whose vehicle identification number has been unregistered cannot be put back into circulation but can be used for undamaged spare parts. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Cars with historical value can be registered, even though they have been unregistered, after a lengthy registration process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> A shop&apos;s estimate in four steps </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66"> With the AudaTaller tool, Audatex guarantees that the user gets an estimate in only 4 steps: identify the vehicle, look for the spare part, create an estimate and generate an estimate. </seg>
<seg id="67"> User friendliness is an essential condition for these systems, especially to convincing older technicians, who, to varying degrees, are usually more reluctant to use new management techniques. </seg>
<seg id="68"> The database includes 1,034 vehicles, 666 of which are cars, 109 sport-utility vehicles, 137 motorcycles, 78 vans and 44 trucks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Naturally, a computer with an internet connection is needed to use it. </seg>
<seg id="70"> After identifying the model to be repaired by its vehicle identification number, an effective graphic image of the model appears, and then the necessary part is selected. </seg>
<seg id="71"> The user can include variables such as the price of labor, surcharges and discounts, and can then print the estimate for the client. </seg>
<seg id="72"> AudaTaller is not an appraisal tool like AudaPlus, but rather a reference catalog. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The main difference is that the system aimed at garages does not include labor time estimates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> The cost of using this tool in a shop is 350 euros a year, which the customer can finance. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Presently, Audatex is working to make these images three-dimensional. </seg>
<seg id="76"> This is an innovation mechanics are approving of because it will enable you, for example, to select a door and turn it around to see the inside. </seg>
