</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The newly elected mayor of the capital will apparently overcome a real language barrier to understand at the level of the Council with their old and new colleagues from the ODS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The daily actualne. cz "tested" the new members of the city council belonging to CSSD, whether they know the argôt who was born in recent years at the town hall, when they were partners in the current coalition who ran in Prague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The coded vocabulary that the cream of Prague started during the previous era of Mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is with surprise that it was discovered that the newly elected officials do not understand very well known terms. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At least they say. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "That is Valdemort." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "I really do not know." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am a jeunôt in the Pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, elected to the culture to the test of the vocabulary of the" Godfather. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And as regards the political veteran, elected Karel Brezina reacted the same way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example, the meaning of "Hole golf." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "This is the only expression among those that you propose that I use" </seg>
<seg id="13"> Otherwise, I do not use the slang. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="16"> Three of the elected representatives have agreed to the quiz, the fourth-Antonin Weinert, who must lead education in Prague in the future - first promised an interview but then did not pick up the phone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth elected Petr Dolinek flatly refused the test. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "I do not at all these things and how fun the representatives of democracy: I will not give my opinion." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "I am currently the way we understand in the context of our programs," he responded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As we have already heard, the elected Lukas Kaucky would not recognize in the legend above, it is the influential Janousek on entrepreneurs and friends of the former mayor Roman Bem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "Voldemort" says nothing á'kaucky and the only expression he guessed in the test is "the greatest golf hole in Prague." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "It is the tunnel Blanka" said Kaucky and adds: "But I know the newspapers." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "I will have to pay a language course," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Not only the matador Karel Brezina But Lukas Plachy, elected for the environment, know that the hole in golf is the tunnel Blanko. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The two Social Democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows where to find the character - he thinks about the meaning of "Go to the pastry." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "It is, I think, to go to a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the Seat of companies Janousek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> On the same tone Brezina recalls that he draws its knowledge rather newspapers and not any vocabulary that he would use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> According to the candidates for tests there is no lexicon of slang in social democracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I have consulted with colleagues and it appears that we really do not have something of this kind." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It is rather the names sometimes used abbreviations and symbols," said Peter Hlinsky, chairman of the Social Democratic Party, that Party members call Hulda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "I called Briza at school but I do not know if my colleagues call me like that, says Karel Brezina about nicknames. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The daily actuel. cz tested the name and it works. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The Weinert is for members of the party or the least friendly little old, the Representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the election by fraud during the sponsorship of the party, is nicknamed "the little toy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The nicknames are also the only ones that use within the party, the Social Democrats. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof looks like the back of a prehistoric reptile, the staircase to a spine of dinosaur and balconies to open fish. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It was the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona architect Antoni Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Because of its organic forms, the House has received from the local nickname of the house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, colors, use of unusual stones, fragments of tiles and mosaîque, facade of scales and present curves, that is all that is ypique for the Art Nouveau Antoni Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The front facade of the House held its dream, colors and textures that recall the nature and animals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In a more detailed observation shows the geometry, the pace and order thought with precision. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the night the facade of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit so that the impression of brightness of colors is reinforced. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The winding and twisting forms also appears in the interiors with the same measure. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wood copy in waves of window frames, balustrades, decorative elements of the Doors, The and strips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Battlo house that stands in the Eixample district in the Market Street Passeig de Gracia to the number. 43, was born of the construction of a house in 1877 architect Emilio Sala Cortes. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The reconstruction was done for two years and the House completed in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, Joseph Battlo, a wealthy entrepreneur, first insisted on the demolition of the old building and the construction of another new but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi an unusual reconstruction and cheaper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> But the idea of Casa Battlo as multi-unit house was not thought by Gaudi alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is precisely on the project that were born decorations for an apartment of representation of the owner of the building and the use of the mosaîque for the facade. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> For the front also worked with other artists and creators. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The joint work plans for the house Casa Battlo began with a cooperation between Jujol and Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Jujol participated in the construction of the House of Gaudi's Casa Mila and Park Guell in which there are other works of Gaudi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The premises have dubbed the House just after the finish because of its organic forms "house in bone." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Others, in the specific mechanism of opening windows have called it "the House that drink." </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is said that at the top of the building there is a sword similar to that of ST. GEORGE, the patron saint of Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Other elements of sculpture construction contain hidden religious grounds. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudi thought to house a single system in its time of central heating, with vents and chimneys. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Their angle of 45 degrees seems odd. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> During the creation Gaudi did not comply with the guidelines of construction and did not let them. </seg>
<seg id="27"> At the beginning of the construction he received from the city building permit, knowing, of course that the data on the reconstruction plans were so vague that two years after finishing the town council was horrified and asked for changes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> He did not like, for example, the members of the Council that the pillars of the construction empiettent on the sidewalk. </seg>
<seg id="29"> There was never any change, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked (and obtained satisfaction) permission to rent the top two floors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The owner moved to lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery on the second floor there was a common living room and the third bedroom and a part of the apartment. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was rented to a jewelry store. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The entire house of six floors is divided by a staircase that leads up to a roof terrace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> All right angles and straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of reconstruction and their replacement by curved walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudi also worked the modern concept of spaces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The common part can be completely by opening the doors of rooms and high society can communicate comfortably or limit the space for more intimate interviews. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The house with the reconstruction of new facades a non-traditional and two floors and more. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The game of Gaudi with light is also impressive, blue and white tiles with which is decorated the courtyard and with the lights. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The game in two colors gives a maximum of light in all the floors of the house. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It was enough simply to bet on the principle that the white reflects more than the dark instead absorbs the sun's rays. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The house Casa Battlo which was included in the World Heritage Fund of UNESCO can be visited by everyone. </seg>
<seg id="42"> On the first floor of the apartment house is the most spacious and most beautiful accessible to the public. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The owners have decided to take this step in 2002 to mark the 150th anniversary of the birth of the famous creator. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="44"> They continued the visits because they found that it is a lucrative business, and they have broadened the scope of visits to the common spaces and attic including the terraces. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> During the several things are critical, the weight, size, age, health status and sex of the owner. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The type of procedure in which we will place the mattress and box spring is also important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> For example, in the house where you do not sleep continuously latex mattresses are not appropriate because they "warm up" slowly. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They have, moreover, a higher than standard polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is necessary to return frequently. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they do not have enough channels in the heart and if they remain, and more, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mold can also be formed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The habit is also decisive in the choice. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Who is the light of time abroad, where it frequently uses very thick mattresses with a layer, will feel well on a low and hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "It is all Hokeyistes returning from NHL complain that they cannot sleep there." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their tired shoulders, legs and ribs, they needed mattress with a layer of foam Rammollisante lazy." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Such mattresses are also recommended for people with diabetes who have a disorder of the nervous system therefore assume" information "joints and skin," says Sylva Adamczikova who specializes in upholstered furniture. </seg>

<seg id="21"> Nothing puts pressure on you and you do not return the night after a difficult match. </seg>
<seg id="22"> You simply sleep better. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, or about 21/34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> A man and a woman of a size of 180 cm therefore need a bed of 210/220 cm. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The minimum width for each for a bed should be 90 cm by 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> For beds in one place, the singles, for example, it is recommended to take at least 120/140 cm. </seg>

<seg id="35"> The bed, when the mattress and box spring are united as Siamese twins, has nothing to do in the bedroom. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The mattresses are aired very badly; we must not wash, which is commonly auhourd' today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since the night is normally from 0.2 to 0.75 L of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to recall a great (and) sieve. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For the specialists refuse to advertise on a life of 25 years for a mattress or a guarantee for life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> But his but. </seg>

<seg id="41"> And even if nowadays it is common to produce coatings with zipper for all, that is to say that after the opening the two parties (for washing and the size of a washing machine is very important!) if not for the models (and for a single person) becomes when cut a fight between a weight and a lorry on a ring. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="47"> For the unique position with 14/18 slats, latex mattresses or so-called sandwiches (perhaps a combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but it will always be better for you to have a mattress with more blades, 28 and above, where the lamellae are doubled in the bottom part of the kidneys and that it is possible to regulate the rigidity. </seg>
<seg id="48"> For the mattress at several positions should not take mattress because it does not respond to the changes of position. </seg>

<p>

<seg id="5"> The jury has rewarded the efforts with which he has transformed a workshop tools in Ceska Skalice firm in the turnover of 100 million kroner. </seg>
<seg id="6"> I can say that the award has encouraged not only me my also my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight competition, "said today the winner of the competition last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the history of the company farmet there was a desire to do something useful. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And so when the state has proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop as compensation after the confiscation of property by the Communists, he did not hesitate for long, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with a few friends in the entourage of his father for the manufacture of plastic tubs. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time they are 40 participants from 19 countries from all continents, from Brazil to Saudi Arabia via Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, a professor of education come from California is fond of the Slow Food movement. He wants in the future to propose a European product quality in the country of the industrial ice. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The master glacier Luciano Ferrari first explained to the participants the ideal characteristics of perfect ice. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Is critical not only good taste, but also the flexibility and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, Luciano does not forget during the training the icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the South: "The Italian ice is simply the best: And then it still retains a dose of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first step in manufacturing seems quite simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano pays the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, milk powder, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer heated to 85 degrees through an electronic program, then immediately to four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> He then opened a valve installed on the machine: It leaves a white cream, foundation for all kinds of ice milk. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The trainer was immediately assailed question: Is it possible to make ice using only natural substances without stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can we give free rein to the personal pleasure of the experiment? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Mr. Luciano warns against the fact be misled by the spirit of the time. </seg>
<seg id="28"> He who speaks only Ice "made from natural ingredients," may nevertheless used stabilizers: most often a natural product, for example, guar seed flour obtained from the guar bean. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is of course possible to make ice without using a stabilizer, only to sell within 24 hours, otherwise it collapses and the customer does nothing other than ice pellets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Some modifications of the base are permitted. </seg>
<seg id="31"> It becomes more exciting with the aromas. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients that it acquires in the fruit or sweets of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> In addition, there are powder and pasta. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "Suppliers will try all of you pass dozens of ingredients." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "However, you should simply try." </seg>
<seg id="36"> In the fruit sorbets with sugar and fresh fruit. </seg>
<seg id="37"> In the ice cream made from the mass of white, adding eggs becomes a yellow cream and is, when you add the cocoa powder, the basis of all the chocolate desserts. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now, all participants must pass to the use of machines to ice. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano invites from time to time to produce four kinds of ice cream: vanilla, chocolate, mocha and hazelnut with or without eggs in the mass, with more or less aroma of vanilla or other natural ingredients. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The different kinds of ice in fruit are also subject to the same experience. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More aromatic substances, more of purées: From the point of view of taste, it is not absolutely better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The ice does not necessarily the taste of the nuts, when it consists largely of hazelnuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The ice the kiwi, very popular, is made from the group using more fruit, less water and a little less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Only a balanced mix is the taste of ice," says Luciano. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The manufacture of ice is an exercise of calculation: If we use the fishing with a lot of sugar, it is that the amount of sugar is reduced to the basic recipe. </seg>
<seg id="46"> A supplement Sugar is necessary for the ice lemon. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano presents a device with which it determines the sugar content of different types of fruit (the winemakers use to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, the tables facilitate the calculations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> The manufacture of ice no longer requires, as in the past, physical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is not only the machine of the Mass. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There is also an apparatus in which it beats simultaneously the mixture of ice available to make it smooth and reduced to zero temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Despite all the automation, minor breakdowns are not excluded. </seg>

<seg id="29"> Some keep it as memory in while also hoping to be able to make it in a reconstruction. </seg>

<seg id="6"> It is the explosion in April, the drilling platform Deepwater Horizon "which is at the root of this strict prohibition. It must remain in force at least for the next five years. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Faced with this accident that claimed the lives of 11 employees and led to the greatest environmental disaster in the United States, President Barack Obama, under pressure from the opposition and the industry, had indicated that he was willing to allow the construction of new drilling in the eastern part of the Gulf of Mexico. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Proponents of this solution and want to reduce the dependence of the United States vis-à-vis foreign countries in terms of oil supply. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The question of who bears responsibility for the devastating oil spill in the Gulf is not, to date, finally resolved. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The British oil group, which faces claims of billions, is at the center of the charges. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A commission of inquiry set up by Obama must present its findings in December. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In October, the secretary of the Interior Ken Salazar had lifted the freeze of drilling imposed after the explosion of the platform. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Following this decision, various oil groups had immediately submitted requests for new drilling projects. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> With more stringent control measures and more stringent safety precautions, Obama and Salazar want to prevent another disaster. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The competent supervisory authority, which was discredited after numerous accusations of corruption, is currently the subject of reforms. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the same time, Mr Obama announced would remove the lucrative tax breaks for oil and gas groups. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The actors in this sector are now publicly against the fact that the flow of food in the Gulf would be much lower than is the case so far. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The government's goal is to put a brake on the rapid growth of the oil and gas sector," according to the result of a survey conducted in the area by the audit firm BDO, before the drilling ban on Wednesday. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Moreover, the American alliance deplores the uncertainty that characterizes this sector: "Nobody knows exactly what will change with the regulations." </seg>
<seg id="20"> Investments in new projects were deferred until further notice, to the detriment of growth. </seg>

<seg id="4"> The airline Qantas now wants to file a complaint against the manufacturer of the engine. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> In early November, the passengers of the airbus belonging to the company had had far more luck: During the investigation, the Australian authority responsible for air safety found that the reactors of some A380 had a serious security problem, and it warns against a possible defect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> This failure could lead to serious consequences: it can cause fatigue cracks and leaks in the connection of the conduct of oil, says in a statement published on Thursday by the administration of the ATSB. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The director of Qantas, Alan Joyce, said that his company would seek damages in relation to the incident in early November. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Parts are detached and the bearing surface was damaged during the fire in the engine. </seg>
<seg id="14"> According to Rolls-Royce, it is the inflammation of oil that is at the origin of the damage. </seg>
<seg id="15"> After this incident, at least 40 reactors must now be replaced in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Australian investigators announced that other tests will be conducted on the superjumbos which are also equipped with the reactors in question. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The recommendations are the result of a collaboration with Rolls-Royce, said the spokesman of the astb, mr. martin Dolan. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The film is an artificial? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind with his film, "Valhalla Rising," the epic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> What the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn well could think turning "Valhalla Rising"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A Viking warrior (Mads Mikkelsen) with only one eye is taken prisoner, he frees himself from his executioner and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his opponents one after the other. It seems ideal for young male viewers in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of murder. When it is in a bad mood, it tears the intestines of its enemies without waiting for them to be dead. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On the other hand, until the end of the film, the one-eyed does not say a word about his real name. Even the other characters escape, at most, one or two sentences some cries of agony. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Otherwise, it is nothing and feasting in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which is the scene of the world of the Vikings, about a thousand years ago. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It would be ideal more mature filmmakers with an interest in existentialism and the excellent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> When a film is several target groups, it is unfortunate that they are mutually exclusive. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher," his trilogy on the drug trafficker and full of style, as a sort of Danish Quentin Tarantinon, but he refuses to bring a little more mood in the mainstream or introduce a little less brutality to the cinema. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most supporters of the cinema art must feel the horror of the brain that is spreading around and intestines. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Fans of action films die of boredom, when the one-eyed sailed, for reasons that can be freely interpreted, with a group of Christian missionaries in a ship bound for Jerusalem; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and the mist before the crew arrives in America and continues to be silent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> It is not surprising that "Valhalla Rising" did not find any distributor of films in Germany and that it exists only in the DVD format. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This is mainly because of the beautiful images of the misery that has earned some attention, but also because the image of an exciting film, from time to time, behind a pretentious and bloody. </seg>
<seg id="15"> It is not dialogue in this film, nor a coherent, everything is fun, a feverish dream turned into a film. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The viewer cannot escape it. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn gives him barely a moment of relaxation and slowly cut the throat with icy images and a soundtrack, but especially with an elusive hatred that comes from the heart of the characters. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a young blond boy, who is faithfully alongside the one-eyed, retains a certain innocence, all the others are driven by anger. </seg>
<seg id="19"> More than anything, the one-eyed hero whose motives are not known, but returns from hell at any time to fight enemies and allies turning into warrior, may be sent by the devil himself. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is the decay, but perhaps also, just for those who are, in any way, rotten. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "Valhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film that you can hate or admire, To the irritation, enthusiasm and surprise. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Love in Time of War </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is going badly since Angelina Jolie has made its debut in the summer as a director. </seg>
<seg id="3"> She wrote the script itself: It is a love story between a woman from Bosnia and a man of Serbian origin. </seg>
<seg id="4"> We know nothing more about this story, but it is enough to cause discomfort. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serbian during the war in Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Bosnian women immediately protested. In response, some sequences of shooting in Sarajevo have been displaced in the last minute in Hungary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Meanwhile, the film is shot in Hungary, but in the post-production phase, the protests continue in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of women victims of war has sent a letter to Angelina Jolie through the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) and demanded to meet the actress. Jolie is a goodwill ambassador for the UNHCR. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is not a diplomat. A few weeks ago, she offered to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but they declined the offer. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The meeting to be held in Bosnia," said Hasecic. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There was no love stories in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Jolie says on its attitude towards the victims. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic, subsequently recommended to the United Nations High Commission to withdraw the quality of goodwill ambassador Angelina Jolie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But, in fact, what kind of scenario Jolie she wrote? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian ministry of culture, which received copies of his scenario, after some hesitation granted permission to film in Sarajevo, but we do not know why not then come despite this authorization. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The young author assures itself that it does not pursue political goals with his film, that it is making a lot of efforts that it was aware of the Yugoslav conflict. She maintains that she wants to highlight the terrible consequences of war and provide an opportunity for all parties involved to express themselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> However, it remains vague about the content. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A second synopsis of the film circulating on the Net. It is quite different: The lovers knew each other well before the start of the war. It will meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, was deported to the concentration camp where the man works as a guard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> This is still a big difference with the version "a victim of rape is love with his executioner." </seg>
<seg id="19"> That the film Jolie began well before the war, of course. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure on it, and Jolie, is "unfair and based on erroneous information." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Now, only the fanatics of Hollywood can provide peace: by illegally this scenario in the net, like many others before. </seg>

<seg id="9"> And yet, despite this, the young man of 26 years trying to have fun, to turn away from the issue, which will result in the future. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The pleasure of playing in Las Vegas is not in his plans. In January, he will conduct job interviews in New Zealand. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I have a strange feeling," he says. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "The homeland is so far and I did not have a job." </seg>
<seg id="13"> FINALLY: His girlfriend is already in Auckland, "in less than two, she won her desired job as project event, perhaps a good sign," said the young man with a smile. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Because of the bleak prospects for the country, two of the Three Sisters Tanner tried their luck abroad. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Her sister Yvonne, a social worker, lives in Sydney, his brother Colin now occupies a position as a computer consultant in London. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The young people go: the situation of most families living on the island are similar to that of Tan. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Experts from the Institute of Economic and social research indicate that 100,000 Irish people leave their country. </seg>
<seg id="18"> They provide a number of 200,000 emigrants by 2015. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This represents a huge loss for a small country of 4.5 million inhabitants. </seg>
<seg id="20"> If these predictions are realized, it will be a flow of emigration comparable to that which Ireland has suffered in the 1980s. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> After a decade of economic boom in which the Irish have enjoyed a great ease, the grief is now taking place. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The economic crisis, however, the young people, well trained, who have known until now only moments of happiness. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The loss of employment and social decline seemed absurd in the years of economic boom. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Everyone had a job, there is money in excess. </seg>
<seg id="25"> But, in the meantime, three out of ten people under 30 years old are unemployed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> The Irish Times newspaper published letters from readers written by young emigrants, who complain: "In Ireland, everything is adrift." </seg>
<seg id="27"> "There should be an uprising against the politicians and bankers, but one that has the potential, and our country as a whole generation." </seg>
<seg id="28"> "The last to leave off the light." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The law student Leanne Caulfield, president of the Union of Irish students, sees a darker future because the government is throwing dust in the eyes and offers no future for young people. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "They reduce the minimum wage, but they have no strategy to create new jobs," said the young student of 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="31"> She sees how his comrades clung to an internship to another. </seg>
<seg id="32"> She said that his greatest concern is to emigrate itself in four years. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "It is a sad and depressing thought." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> However, men like Stephen McLarnon try to address this issue positively. </seg>
<seg id="35"> McLarnon organizes the show "Workingabroadexpo" which offers full support on the theme "Working Abroad." </seg>
<seg id="36"> "But the work abroad is for those new to the profession an extraordinary opportunity to take the first steps in the ranks of the hierarchy," said the official. </seg>
<seg id="37"> His website shows photos of surfers in Australia and surfers in Canada. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The message is clear: Work abroad is not a nightmare, but it also guarantees freedom and pleasure. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> For six months, Seán O'Donovan, knows what it means to be based elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="40"> As there was nothing to do in Ireland for the engineer of 29 years, he now works with 15 colleagues in the Irish construction sector E Germany. </seg>
<seg id="41"> A fashion house just sort of land in Gelsenkirchen. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In January, he will continue to work on other projects Hanover and Berlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Meanwhile, O'Donovan rarely visit his native country, because it participates in an additional work, in order to be able to complete to repay the credit contracted to build his house at home. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "The situation is already a little crazy," he says in crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I live any more." </seg>
<seg id="46"> He bursts into laughter through the cold. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The house is in a residential area with gardens well cared for, expensive cars of famous brands are stationed on the roads. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Four years ago, Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380,000 euros, financed 100 percent by the credit. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "There were moments of madness, no doubt, money was easy," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Is he afraid to collapse because of the credit? </seg>
<seg id="51"> For a moment, pours hot tea and said: "I have no children to maintain and I am young; even everything goes wrong, I can start from zero." </seg>
<seg id="52"> The engineer of the building does not like the lament that he often lately. </seg>
<seg id="53"> "Nobody should suffer from hunger, our situation is not as dramatic as what was once lived here on the island," he says. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "Working for a time abroad, this is not what can happen worse, perhaps it is what we feel first Irish. </seg>
<seg id="55"> He laughs and then spoke of his father who went to England during the last major economic crisis. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "He was back after having spent seven years and, in Ireland, life continued, simply." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> The idea appeals to Cian Tanner. </seg>
<seg id="58"> Let the future and discover how life happens elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="59"> In his list, he already has a few years of working in London. That is why life should not be as easy in New Zealand for him and his girlfriend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> But there is still something that worries many in recent days: the party to organize on the occasion of his 27th birthday in Dublin. </seg>
<seg id="61"> He fears that it could turn into a farewell. </seg>
<seg id="62"> "Only, not a lot of emotions," he said, drinking a long sip of beer. </seg>
<seg id="63"> "A Farewell, it is still worrying." </seg>
<seg id="64"> "Call it rather an evening of goodbye, very relaxed, with a few friends, with a few drinks and some games." </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1"> The democratic routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Support for democracy in Latin America continues to grow, as private enterprise. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The crime has become a greater concern than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And Brazil is seen as more influential than the United States in much of the region. </seg>
<seg id="5"> These are some of the conclusions of the latest Latinobarómetro poll taken in 18 countries and published exclusively by The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Since the survey was conducted on a regular basis since 1995, it tracks changes in attitude in the region. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two elements emerge from the results of the survey of this year, conducted in September and early October. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The first is the sunny mood of Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The second is the increasing stability of attitudes toward democracy and its key institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Support for democracy has increased significantly in several countries on the Pacific rim of South America (see table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example in Peru, where economic growth has averaged 6% per year since 2002, support for democracy from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It has also increased in Mexico, where the economy has rebounded after a sharp drop in production last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only about half of the respondents in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populous countries in the region, are convinced democrats, which lowers the regional average (see table 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some 44% of respondents in the region expressed satisfaction with the way democracy in their country worked in practice; it is the same figure as last year but with a sharp increase on the 25% in 2001 (Chart 3) </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% said they had confidence in the parliament of their country and 45% in their government, the same as last year in both cases, but up sharply compared to 2003 (17% and 24% respectively). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America have undermined support for democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> If it has held good during the global financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that many countries have suffered only a brief recession and have benefited from a strong recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, a network of social security has helped to protect the poor. </seg>
<seg id="19"> (The United Nations Economic Commission for Latin America reported this week that the proportion of Latin Americans living in poverty increased only slightly in 2009 and again this year, to 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But the mood varies considerably from one country to another (see chart 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> The good economic performance of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, a widely shared sense of progress </seg>
<seg id="22"> What is more rare in Mexico and Central America, where the recession was more severe and where violent crimes have increased. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It is only the second time since the survey began that more respondents across Latin America as a whole have cited the crime rather than unemployment as the most important issue for their country (see table 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> About 31% say they or their have been the victim of a criminal act in the past year, however, this figure is down from 38% last year and is the lowest since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> A more robust economic performance is reflected in the increase in support for private enterprise and the market economy: About 71% of respondents in the region say that private enterprise is essential for development, against 56% in 2007 (see Chart 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Some 58% believe that the market economy is the only system that will make their developed country, against 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interestingly, 62% of respondents in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support private enterprise); even if their president, Hugo Chavez, expropriated many private companies. </seg>
</p>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Nobody expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But it was far worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the stricken country and plunged in fear. </seg>
<seg id="4"> It was presented ballot boxes and a new election, ballots scattered in the Goutières, polling stations and intimidation </seg>
<seg id="5"> Polling stations opened late in the evening. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Many hatïens, including many who were displaced following the earthquake in January, wandering in the neighborhood to find where to vote. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some of them were eventually abandoned. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A dozen presidential candidates, including several favorites, denounced the fraud and called for the annulment of the election. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Protests, sometimes violent, have exploded across the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Nevertheless, Edmond Mulet, the top official in Haiti to the United Nations, sees the event as "a pretty good in many respects." </seg>
<seg id="11"> Observers from the Organization of American States and the Caribbean Community said cautiously that they did not believe that these irregularities, as serious as they are, necessarily invalidated the process. " </seg>
<seg id="12"> In other words, the show continues. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to René Préval, President unpopular, and its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce preliminary results on 7 December. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The expected second round is scheduled for January. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Any hope in the election is not lost. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The two opposition candidates, Michel Martelly, a rap musician, and Mirlande Manigat, a former first lady, withdrew from their initial call for the vote to be declared invalid. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But there may be problems if mr. Célestin, who has little or no discernible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached the second round reached the second round. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> With a cholera epidemic raging, and more than 1 million survivors of the earthquake who are still living in tents, it was feared that participation would be. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In this case, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing so because of the disruption. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Nearly 250,000 identity cards needed to vote, were not yet distributed shortly before the election. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The issue is important. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Donors see the election of a popular and legitimate government as an important step in the reconstruction of Haiti. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And so, it is clear, Haitians themselves. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The weeks after becoming a widow, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, has benefited from a wave of public sympathy that has improved his approval rate of 20 points, more than 50%; it is its highest level since it was elected in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Yet, turn it into a successful campaign for a second term in an election next year could depend on the choice of Ms Fernández, visibly in mourning, that it would abandon or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And, in this regard, the signs are still confused. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Mr Kirchner, who has continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeded him as president, used to develop budgets that underestimated tax revenues, economic growth and inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This allowed the first couple to spend the extra money at will. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The government of Ms Fernández has lost its majority in Congress last year, on paper. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided, and the situation has fallen into disarray following the death of Mr Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some of the dissident members of the ruling Peronist movement rallied to Ms Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic sessions (where a Member has hit in the face one of his peers and others have accused the government of corruption), Congress failed to approve the 2011 budget. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I am not going to argue," said the president. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Currently, the 2010 budget will be implemented next year, leaving the president even greater flexibility to spend at will. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The Economy Overheating widely: it is likely to grow by nearly 9% this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official rate of inflation now stands at 11.1% but many private estimates and wage demands of unions, see this figure close to 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Mr Kirchner, who took office in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, has made a priority of growth and poverty reduction, rather than the control of inflation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to deal with the IMF, he harassed the private sector and served the INDEC, the Statistical Office, which conducted the falsification of official statistics on inflation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Ms Fernández now moderating these policies? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It called for talks between private companies and union leaders. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And officials say they want to limit wage increases next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The economy has been driven by high world prices for agricultural exports from Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But inflation has eroded the boost to growth after a sharp devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> That may be why Ms Fernández shows signs of wanting to restore the financial relations of Argentina to the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This year, the government has concluded an agreement with bondholders who had rejected a previous restructuring of the debt that Argentina had not paid its debts in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now Ms Fernández seems to be edging towards an agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes some $6.7 trillion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The Kirchners have always insisted that this could involve surveillance by the IMF, as is customary. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, Amado Boudou, the economy minister, announced that the fund would provide "technical assistance" to design a new national index of consumer prices, which looks like a prelude to the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not clear whether Ms Fernández wants to stay in politics beyond the end of his mandate, now that her husband is no longer at his side. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If it does, it needs to win the support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerisme is advocated. </seg>
<seg id="29"> When the Argentines will be returned from their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy for her has ebbed. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If she wants to win another election, she will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, many policies of her husband. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Perform at the request of a president, and people are required to read it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Esperanza Spalding, the jazz bassist and singer 26 years hand-picked by President Obama to occur during the ceremony of the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination in the category of "Best New Artist." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Considering that Spalding is a well-known figure on the jazz scene since his 2008 album, "Esperanza," the appointment remains a bit mysterious, but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards that an artist should not leave more than three albums before recording; what "establishes the public identity of that artist." </seg>
<seg id="5"> His ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Music Society," marked a step forward and, given his vocal style slightly, his hand of pop and funk and Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line to Spalding from the meteoric success of Norah Jones in 2003, the nearest equivalent to the voters of the Grammy Awards, taking into account production of Jazz in this category in recent years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards have rightly honoured "Historicity" Vijay Iyer trio in the category "instrumental album," transferred on a thrill of a recording that was one of the last year. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Among these Iyer, "Moody 4 B" veteran saxophonist James Moody and "positootly" keyboardist John Beasley will be in competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Trombone Shorty, favorite to the voice of New Orleans and frequent guest on "Treme" HBO, was honoured in the category of contemporary jazz, which also strongly towards a merger with the albums of Stanley Clarke, John McLaughlin and Jeff Lorber. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Secret Society of wild Darcy James Argue, familiar with the steampunk, has won some well-deserved recognition in the category; in competition with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs ensemble and the eternal Dave Holland, whose album "pathways" octet's live was a fine example of the hand of this bass as a democratic leader. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A microbe tolerant arsenic raises the possibility of new types of life on Earth, or elsewhere. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a strange bacteria, which can use arsenic as one of its nutrients, broadens the scope to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although the researchers have discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say it shows that life has possibilities beyond the major elements that were considered essential. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This body has a dual capacity." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "It can be developed with phosphorus or arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "That is why it is very special, even if it is far from being a form of life really" foreign, "said Paul c. w. Davies of the University of Arizona State, co-author of the report appearing in the online edition of the journal Science on Thursday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Six major elements have long been considered essential for life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But the researchers have discovered that the bacteria, discovered in the Mono Lake in California, is able to continue to grow after replacing phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what is still possible," said Ariel Anbar d. of the State University of Arizona, co-author of the report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is important in the search for life beyond Earth because researchers must be able to recognize life, know what life is like, says Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study focuses on a microbe found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not disclose the details of the find, has generated widespread speculation on the Internet that the report would disclose the discovery of extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> This was not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that in other planetary environments, organizations may be able to use other elements to operate biochemistry and that" standard "All the elements, that we consider absolutely necessary for life, could not be fixed," said Charles Cockell, a professor at the Institute of Planetary Research and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockell was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is new because it shows the substitution of one element to another basic biochemistry and biochemical structure," said Cockell. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> It was not a fortuitous discovery. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrology of NASA, who led the study, chose the Mono Lake because it has high levels of arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar; thus, it was speculated that a microbe exposed to two substances may be able to substitute one another. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is very similar to that of phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "As a result, the agencies have difficulty in distinguishing these elements separately." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But arsenic is sufficiently different that it does not work exactly as phosphorus; it penetrates the inside and, to some extent, the work of our biochemical machine," said Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers collected the bacterium known as gfaj-1 and were exposed to increasing concentrations of arsenic to which she was able to adapt and grow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows better with phosphorus, but the fact that he can live with arsenic in place raises the possibility that a form of life using Arsenic can occur naturally, or else on Earth or another planet or the moon where arsenic is more common. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Jamie S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea that arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new, but nothing has ever shown that it could walk. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the earth, she said, so the researchers hypothesized that the first forms of life could have used. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> This suggests that there may be other ways of life, not only how life on Earth was formed at the beginning, "said Foster, who was not part of the research team from Wolfe-Simon. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The research was funded by NASA, the Department of Energy and the National Institute of Health. </seg>

<seg id="61"> This year, hundreds of citizens in Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the spread of false rumors that the chengguan had killed a seller. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the Chengguan were injured, 14 government vehicles were overturned or set on fire. </seg>

<seg id="64"> But the calm is not guaranteed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The appeal of Cheshire will point to Twitter </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A half-dozen of them were typing away in the rows of the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They sent every minute of the reports of horrific stories via Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end, the defense said that there were more than 140,000 messages on the trial of the case of rape and children tied to their beds in a house that was burned. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> On Thursday, the trial largely followed by Steven j. Hayes, who was convicted of the murder of three members of the family in Cheshire, Connecticut, should lead to a formal end when the judge would impose the death penalty, voted by the jury. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But lawyers for Mr. Hayes have already filed to the court that outline arguments of appeal, likely to occupy the courts for years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> What is provocative, it is that the intense coverage of the trial - as well as the widespread use and extended by journalists of the Twitter - have created a "circus atmosphere," so widespread and instant saturation with incendiary details that the jury was improperly influenced by the passions of the public. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The demand could push the judges to debate on the question of whether new technologies require new rules in the courtroom. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I have experience at this trial, I think there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies in the courtroom violates the rights of the person to a fair trial," said Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer for Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The trial judge, Jon c. Blue of state Superior Court, has rejected the claims in the ruling last week, saying that the media were "carefully controlled" and that there was no evidence that the jury would have been facilitated by the passion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that does not seem to be the last word on the issue. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The courts have recognized for decades that the media coverage of notorious cases may raise questions about the fairness of a trial. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a judgment of 1966 landmark, the Supreme Court of the United States overturned the conviction of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Sheppard, for the murder of his wife, arguing in its decision that there was a "carnival atmosphere at the trial" because of the media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The crime is considered by some to have been the inspiration for the television show and movie "The Fugitive." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Some lawyers said that the appellate courts to review a half a century later the conviction of Mr. Hayes may be curious given the argument that new rules could be needed to manage the means of communication of courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "There is a general reason to worry about the impact of new media" in the large-scale trials, said John j. Donohue III, a professor at the Stanford Law School who has studied the death penalty in Connecticut and wrote a report that she was arbitrarily applied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue said that some judges could be intrigued by the idea that the limitation of instant communication from the courtrooms could allow fairer trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The case of Twitter is only one of many described by lawyers for Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed for years, delaying the execution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defense lawyers also say, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered injury when the judge refused to allow them to test the reactions of potential jurors by showing grisly photos of crime scenes in the selection of the jury. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of the jurors said they were horrified by the pictures of the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Petit, 48, and her daughters, Hayley, 17, and Michaela, 11 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defense lawyers say they will also challenge the constitutionality of the death penalty and that they will argue that the judge unfairly expelled one juror, who had been critical to the prosecutors, and that he improperly put pressure for a verdict by taking the unusual step of bringing the jury to deliberate in a weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The jurors were not sequestered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the trial could be the greatest source of interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They noted in a protest against the verdict, filed last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and it was discussed during the election campaign by the candidates for governor and the Senate of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They maintained that the computer media kept fanning the flames of the emotion of the case. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "The daily tweets of media, cameras and journalists to the courthouse," the lawyers wrote, "not unlike anything that had been seen before here in New Haven, and perhaps even at the national level." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Their focus on the cover of the Twitter system is controversial. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In interviews, some journalists said that the claim that the instant news were more incendiary than delivered more slowly, was a luddiste that would impoverish the court's policy governing media coverage of the future trials. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But some lawyers said that the Courts of Appeal étaitent often attracted by the arguments that the social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Lawyers for Mr. Hayes insist on this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their case, they make a reference to the decision of the Supreme Court of 1966 which had overturned the conviction of Dr. Sheppard because of media coverage of the trial and they said they would invoke the need for new rules for the new media. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This case," they wrote, "is that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21st century." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The control of the city is in the hands of a "kleptocracy" and put up to the Kremlin part of bribes and protection money that it collects, reported the U.S. Embassy in Russia in a note in February. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The police and the Federal Security Service are making huge rackets that help explain the high cost of living in Moscow, he said. </seg>
<seg id="4"> They collect money not only legitimate businesses but also of organized criminal groups. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Each layer of bureaucracy - what Prime Minister Vladimir Putin has called the "vertical of power" - takes its share while the money went to the top of the ladder. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The memo, which was sent to Washington under the name of Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The note is based on sources whose names were redacted. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written when Yuri Luzhkov was still mayor of Moscow; and it is largely responsible for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He was fired in October by President Dmitry Medvedev, but there has since been few traces of cleaning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Luzhkov and his wife, Elena Baturina, who owns a construction company, always denied the accusations of corruption over the years; and he has won several libel trial on these charges. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In September, he said that a Russian television channel, when he was asked about a documentary suggesting that he was corrupt: "It is crazy, it is to throw, it is anything." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Russians believe, with an overwhelming majority, that their society is corrupt; according to the polls. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual to find the information contained in a report of embassy; and it is incredible to imagine that this would be to diplomats of a foreign country to do so. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The direct link between the Government of the city of Moscow and Crime has led some to call it "dysfunctional" and to say that the government worked more as a kleptocracy that a government, "according to the note of the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "The criminal elements have a" krysha "(a term used in the criminal world/the mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) that passes through the police, the Federal Security Service (FSB), the Ministry of the Interior (MVD) and the prosecutor's office, as well as through the bureaucracy of the Government of the city of Moscow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "The analysts to identify a three-tier structure in the criminal world of Moscow." </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Luzhkov is at the top." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The FSB and the MVD and the militias are on the second level." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "Finally, common criminals and corrupt inspectors are at the lowest level." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "It is an inefficient system in which criminal groups fills a void in some areas where the city does not provide certain services." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The report indicates that the FSB breaststroke silver of the largest companies and that the police target small. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> A source, he said, "explained that the owners of Moscow understood that it was better to secure the protection of the FSB and MVD (rather than organized crime groups), because not only do they have more weapons, more money and more power than the criminal groups but they are also protected by law." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "That is the reason for the request for protection by criminal gangs is not as high." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The note said that, although the collection of money is extended, the protection itself can be uneven, even those who pay are sometimes subject to arrest. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Those who do not pay quickly see their business close under one pretext or another. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Medvedev has repeatedly raised the fight against corruption, but he admitted the little progress. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The note from the embassy sends reports of men who bring suitcases, probably filled with money, to the Kremlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "In its fight against corruption, Medvedev depends on the bureaucrats," said in a recent interview Georgy Satarov, director of the think tank INDEM "of Moscow. </seg>
<seg id="29"> "But it is part of the bureaucracy." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "It is not part of a political class because they do not exist in Russia." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Without politics, without opposition, without separation of powers, he said, corruption is inevitable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> According to INDEM, the costs of corruption would amount to the whole of Russia, to more than 300 billion dollars a year. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The country was ranked 154th in a recent survey on the overall perception of corruption by the non-governmental organization Transparency International (the countries are ranked from least to most corrupt). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The disclosure of the note of the American Embassy, which was conducted yesterday, late in the evening, Moscow time, with certainty of discontent within the Russian government, although Luzhkov can be blamed, to some extent, for the failures of Moscow, this could be an opportunity for the Kremlin to show that it is to solve the problem. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The veterans of the Khmer Rouge forced to confront the past </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> In a poorly lit classroom with concrete walls of poor quality, the director of the school of Anlong Veng evoked the man who had built, the last Khmer Rouge leader, Ta Mok. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "Everyone here loves Ta Mok." </seg>
<seg id="4"> "It was a good leader; and he cared about his people," said Sreng Kor Ma, 42. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Known as "The Butcher" for his brutality, when he was the head of the Khmer Rouge, the commander remains popular in this isolated bastion of former Khmer Rouge in northwestern Cambodia where he has built hospitals, bridges and other infrastructure; and where thousands of former soldiers of the organization still live today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> But this year, 12 years after the Khmer Rouge went to the government, the loyalty is finally challenged in Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In April, a local forum of Truth and Reconciliation allowed victims to respond publicly to the people who had participated in the scheme. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In June, the government has distributed a manual of high school, which for the first time, teaches the history of the Khmer Rouge to the children of former soldiers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> And, in July, a Cambodian court, jointly run with the United Nations, made its first sentence for a former member of the Khmer Rouge, condemning, to 35 years in prison, the former head of the notorious Tuol Sleng torture center, Kaing Khek Iev, better known as "Duch." </seg>
<seg id="10"> In this situation, the increased anxiety among veterans of the Khmer Rouge in Anlong Veng, complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wishes to reintegrate into Cambodian society. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "There is resentment and fear among the former Khmer Rouge but they are powerless to do anything," said Youk Chhang, director of the Documentation Center of Cambodia, an independent organization that conducts research on the regime. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "For them, life under the Khmer Rouge was glorious but the regime has become a symbol of evil." </seg>
<seg id="13"> "The situation creates divisions within families." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in Cambodia, from 1975 to 1979, about 1.7 million people were executed or died of starvation, disease or overwork. </seg>
<seg id="15"> When the Vietnamese invaded and overthrew the government of Pol Pot-United in 1979, the rest of the regime and its army fled to the border with Thailand. </seg>
<seg id="16"> There, they launched an insurgency that lasted until the last movements in December 1998. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> While Pol Pot, Nuon Chea and Ieng Sary led the guerrillas from their base in the mountains of western Cambodia and in the jungle, Ta Mok was preparing a response to Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="18"> But in the mid-1990s, after a peace agreement sponsored by the UN has led to the country's first democratic elections in 1993, large groups of Khmer Rouge fighters began to defect to the government, culminating with the capitulation of Ieng Sary in 1996 and Nuon Chea and Khieu Samphan in 1998. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Pol Pot died of natural causes in 1998 and Ta Mok, who had stood up, was captured by government forces in 1999 in the mountains near Dangrek. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He died in a prison in Phnom Penh in 2006 pending his trial. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Without their benefactors, most of the Khmer Rouge veterans have sunk into abject poverty, common in rural areas of Cambodia; and many remain nostalgic for the movement. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Although some elite officers Khmer Rouge kept their posts in local leader in exchange for having laid down their arms, it is farmers in low rank and file. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> "These people have benefited very little follow-up after the capitulation," said Sok Leang of the Centre for Justice and Reconciliation, which organizes public forums throughout Cambodia, including Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="24"> "They are soaked in the agrarian utopian ideology of the regime." </seg>
<seg id="25"> "They were raised in an environment where business is a foreign concept." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Sor Lim, 55, who joined the Khmer Rouge as a teenager in 1974, fought in the jungle around Anlong Veng before settling in 1998 as poor rice farmer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "Life under the Khmer Rouge was good," he said. </seg>
<seg id="28"> "Ta Mok feeds everyone." </seg>
<seg id="29"> But now, life is difficult because we must meet our own needs. " </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The Khmer Rouge tribunal has also caused worries here. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The court should, at the beginning of next year, to begin the trial of Nuon Chea, Khieu Samphan, Ieng Sary and his wife, Ieng Thirith, another former Khmer Rouge minister. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The mandate of the Tribunal is to try senior leaders and those most responsible for the crimes but he has not said if he continued beyond these four cases. </seg>
<seg id="33"> It would be more to calm fears in Anlong Veng. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The recent media speculation turned to IM Chaem, aged 64, former chief of district in the province of Banteay Meanchey under the reign of the Khmer Rouge in the 1970s. </seg>
<seg id="35"> In 2007, she said the researchers of the Documentation Center of Cambodia that she had supervised the construction of the dam Trapeang thma, a project where thousands of forced labourers were killed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Recently, at a torrid evening, Im Chaem home from work in the field near his wooden house on stilts, on a dirt road outside Anlong Veng. </seg>
<seg id="37"> As the sun cast long shadows on the grass, Im Chaem refused to discuss his past in the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
<seg id="38"> If the court convened, she said, she would refuse to go there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> "Cambodia is at peace and stable," she said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> "If there are more prosecutions, there will be war." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Prime Minister Hun Sen, who defected from the Khmer Rouge in 1978, has also repeatedly warned that instability would occur if the court had several suspects, although experts and historians dispute this. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> "Cambodia to dig a hole and bury the past," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> But the past is that Cambodia must do to move forward, said Youk Chhang, of the Documentation Centre. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Reconciliation in Khmer is to reconnect the broken pieces," he said. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "We must put these pieces together so that we can understand." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The center has produced the first textbook approved by the Government on the Khmer Rouge, "a history of Democratic Kampuchea, consisting of 75 pages." </seg>
<seg id="47"> It was distributed to Anlong Veng in June as a supplement to the history textbooks of the Ministry of Education, designed for high schools, which contained less than four pages on the Khmer Rouge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="48"> As in most of Cambodia, the young Anlong Veng know only a few details about the Khmer Rouge, despite the links of the city to the regime. </seg>
<seg id="49"> Touch Valeak, 19, a student at the high school in Anlong Veng, said that the new manual was helping students understand an important part of their history. </seg>
<seg id="50"> But his parents have reacted with skepticism when he returned with the book home to study. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> "My family rejects many parts of the Manual and the court," he said. </seg>
<seg id="52"> "They are wary because they do not know exactly how many people the court will continue." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> Such resistance has made the process of reconciliation complex and difficult, "said Sok Leang. </seg>
<seg id="54"> But public forums, the manual and the Court are beginning to have an impact, "he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> However, the Khmer Rouge retain a powerful atrait here. </seg>
<seg id="56"> IN THE MOUNTAINS OF Dangrek, a road, overgrown with weeds and strewn with plastic bags, led to a rectangle of black soot, covered with a rusty tin roof. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The body of Pol Pot was burned here on a pile of tires after his death in 1998. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> Nuom Sothea, aged 31, of Mobile Phone roadside, said that she did not know much about the man who was cremated at this location. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> "But it has a great spirit; and many people go there to pray," she said. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="1"> Belarus agrees to waive its stock of weapons-grade uranium </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The Government of Belarus announced Wednesday that it would abandon its stock of highly enriched uranium, an essential component for nuclear weapons; this is part of a surprise victory of the campaign of President Obama to secure nuclear materials around the world </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The agreement was disclosed in a joint statement issued after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met the foreign minister of Belarus, Sergei Martynov, on the sidelines of a summit on security. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had tried for years to convince Belarus to give up highly enriched uranium and seemed to have cleared the horizon last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But US officials told The Washington Post that some classified operations were conducted with Belarus over the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds of weapons-grade uranium from a research centre of Belarus. </seg>
<seg id="6"> This opened the way for an agreement Wednesday to eliminate the rest of the field of about 500 pounds, according to an official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the issue. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement appears to be one of the most important results of the Nuclear Security Summit of 47 nations, organized at the initiative of Obama; where Belarus was excluded. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Apparently, it was good to get an invitation to the former Soviet republic following the summit in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the nuclear security summit in 2012 nuclear security summit." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "This proves to me that this process works," said Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for Global Security, a group of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton called the agreement "very significant, important" by Belarus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama has pledged to Prague in April 2009 to secure all vulnerable nuclear materials around the world within four years. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the U.S. government has helped six countries to get rid of all its highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Belarus would be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries have been under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of the summit on nuclear safety of Obama, the Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko, said that the nation would never abandon its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "We kept the highly enriched uranium, hundreds of kilograms of what is essentially the weapons-grade uranium and low-enriched uranium," said Mr Lukashenko. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "This is our product ... we are not going to make dirty bombs, and we will sell it to anyone." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We will use it for research purposes, that is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Belarus has approached the United States a few months ago; however, expressing interest in reaching an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first implementation to remove uranium from Belarus, in October, was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, officials said. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was loaded on a special train that ran more than 1,300 miles to a facility in Russia to be stored and eliminated, officials said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second operation was completed Monday and was carried by air, according to the officials. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government spent $13 million in its efforts, in large part to replace the research facilities of Belarus with low enriched uranium; unsuitable for weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "A careful coordination and organization have been implemented in order to strengthen confidence," leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, said Andrew Bieniawski, head of the Department of Energy in the threat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> According to estimates by the Center for Study of James Martin, Belarus had this year at least 88 pounds of weapons-grade uranium, as well as hundreds of kilograms of highly enriched uranium. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Belarus seeks to eliminate its stockpiles by 2012, according to a joint statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Relations between Belarus and the United States are strained for years, mainly because of the harsh repression by Lukashenko of human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the statement Wednesday suggested a potential revival. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "While welcoming the progress on these issues of global security, the United States and Belarus have recognized that a greater respect for democracy and human rights in Belarus remained essential to improve bilateral relations; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she said. </seg>

<seg id="4"> In June 2006, after a report by the Council of Europe, which accused of complicity in practices contrary to human rights in a dozen countries, including Spain, took place a meeting between the former American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández de la Vega. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The vice-president acknowledged that the Council's report "had surprised the government of Zapatero offside" and insisted that Spain had nothing to hide. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "De la Vega said that Spain had no objection to the intelligence over the Spanish territory." </seg>
<seg id="7"> "They just want to be informed" to avoid "taken by surprise," Aguirre in a cable. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The holder of the Ministry of External this time, Miguel Angel Moratinos, said the Spanish ambassador that the executive "wanted to give this matter the lowest possible, even if, as it was in the hands of judges, the government had a limited ability to influence." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In turn, in January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the embassy that he would not block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of documents from the National Intelligence Centre (CNI) and the Ministry of Defence on the CIA flights. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "These reports contain no incriminating, no sensitive information," said the embassy after talking with the Prosecutor. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The United States showed their concern for "the apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and prosecutors" more than for information of cni o of the Ministry of Defence. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "This coordination between independent investigators will complicate our efforts to handle the case quietly between the governments," said Aguirre. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In March of 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador and the minister of internal, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, he commented that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider appropriate," he had given instructions to his staff "to avoid the comments of an inflammatory rhetoric, trying to lower the temperature." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The ambassador also expressed his concern for the action of PP in this case. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "In spite of its pro-American general orientation, our experience suggests that PP certainly will take advantage of any indication that the government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately ignored the actions of the United States that could be interpreted as possible violations of human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she noted. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The President of the popular Catalan arrived at the rendezvous with Artur Mas with security that gives the fact of having obtained 18 deputies in the elections last Sunday, more than enough to be love, because the candidate of CiU requires that at least one of the training that will exercise the opposition abstaining in the voting for the nomination. </seg>
<seg id="4"> A possible agreement with the PP depend on future alliances that the nationalists want to maintain in the Congress during the general election, but, for the moment, the conversations that MAS has these days with the rest of political leaders are key in Catalan. </seg>
<seg id="5"> And as the President of the PP, to support a nomination "should eliminate all speeches separatists and economic independence," and complicity - similar to that of the Basque Country - that the leader wants to submit itself to the referendum. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The owners of the centre of Olot does not eliminate the possibility that their night nurse has killed more than 11 elderly </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The geriatric Caritat Olot (Girona) offered a press conference yesterday to highlight the damage done to the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the nurse who killed at least eleven elderly which he was responsible in the meantime he worked there. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The director of the residence, Joan Sala, accompanied by counsel for the centre, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of the caritat would be able to exercise the charge against the person responsible" for the deaths but "the legality and responsibility require us to take the situation of civilian officials." </seg>
<seg id="5"> And apart from the social entity can suffer for not having detected in time the criminal activities of the nurse at night, the greatest threat to the Caritat now takes the form of a large compensation that the legal representatives of the relatives of the victims already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé admitted that the first crime date of August 2009 and that from this day he has not stopped killing. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge said in sentencing that he ordered the exhumation of eight bodies - Former patients of Geriatric care - he suspected that in many cases no doctor explored the deceased personally but, given the age and health of patients, the formality was conducted by telephone. </seg>

<p>

<seg id="12"> The director of the Caritat mentioned the fact that it is difficult to control access to the Centre for Medicines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used in six of the nine crimes that the nurse, in his desire to alleviate the suffering of internal, used to kill them. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the laboratory tests will clarify if Vila does not lie by saying that he has sought for its first victims a less cruel or otherwise it has burned inside giving them as he has already admitted that he made with the three women he killed in the meantime 12 - 17 October. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The CARITAT does not believe the statements of the night, not the number of murders, they do not eliminate the possibility that the number is larger and justify their attitude by the different versions that Vila gave in his visits to the Court of First Instance and the lack of logic in the change in the way of killing after successfully committing eight murders. </seg>

<seg id="3"> The peripherals have closed the strength and the actions of the European banks have suffered more than 5%. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, we should not underestimate the ability of ECB to be wrong and the euro has barely registered an increment, which is a signal. </seg>
<seg id="5"> What happened yesterday is typical of a liquid market in the same way that it collapses, it recovered, but motivated by fences of short and very speculative positions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The institutional investor take long to lose the fear. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A month ago, ECB gave us today to withdraw liquidity measures and it will withdraw tomorrow for the fourth time in two years and those who remain. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Bundesbank demanded the finalisation of the plan of public debt because of its inefficiency and the elimination of all extraordinary measures of liquidity and leaving only unlimited access to the week. </seg>
<seg id="9"> After the Irish crisis hope that extends the current liquidity measures "at least until March" and maintain the auction quarterly unlimited access to the end of the quarter to ensure liquidity at least until June. </seg>
<seg id="10"> We hope that we will continue with the program of obligations and that it even gives the signal to intensify. </seg>
<seg id="11"> If they do not fulfill the expectations generated, they will overturn the excellent market reaction yesterday and if they continue blinded to withdraw the liquidity measures, God help us! </seg>
<seg id="12"> As well as during their meeting in May in which they said that they had not even considered buying bonds and they have markets, history could repeat tomorrow. </seg>

<seg id="19"> The estimated figures represent 10,000 million short-term and 15,000 potential and they have a deadline until February to get private capital or they will be nationalized. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Even if Ireland has no credibility after not having detected the problem in July with the stress test, the figures are assumables in the plan of assistance and help reduce uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, the next Tuesday, the government will have to obtain parliamentary approval of its new budget and it has not yet sufficient support, as Ireland remains in a home of uncertainty. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Angela Merkel has moderated the tone of his speech to release the tension before the next Summit of Heads of State and Government on December 14 in which it is necessary to find a political compromise that shows that we are a union and that we interpret all the same score. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The problem is that Germany wants to interpret Wagner and the rest of the anthem of the joy of Beethoven. </seg>

<seg id="30"> They would give us a line of liquidity which we do not need, the Treasury has more than 40 million in available liquidity, triple compared to March, with types very expensive and they cut access to markets indefinitely. </seg>

<seg id="13"> The third, a new design of the euro, in line with the German proposals for greater macro-economic control, budgetary rigour, fines on countries that violate them, possible suspension of payments of one of them and extension to the private sector costs of potential adjustments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and it's been a long time it is defined, so now there is no room for excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> First, in 2009, when both the IMF and the European Commission stimulated deficits, the German government has invented a constitutional reform to prevent them from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought that we had to do (plans for fiscal austerity and stability of public finances) and its European partners, ci-includes France, practiced. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second blow of the central European country was when Merkel has extended the decision to save Greece. </seg>
<seg id="18"> From that time it was the subject of a fierce criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and public opinion and Published were against the rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, towards the end of October, Merkel again expresses a clear position, calling for the reform of the treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and at the same time to private lenders to bear a share of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position has been interpreted as anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the rest. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But his proposal, although a little watered down, has been approved, and the following month, we should see the process of reform of the Union which is possible these measures from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany has drawn a red line that it does not cross. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And she tells us all that, even if now we must take measures with which it may not be too much, from this date the former functioning of the euro would have finished. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will mean the birth of a new monetary zone, in which the countries that violate the rules will be severely punished, they may be forced to be declared in default, and in this case, the private sector will also support a party of costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany tells us that we must follow a strict path of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, improvements in productivity and competitiveness and external balances. </seg>
<seg id="26"> An alternative based on debt and construction, with huge holes in the balance of payments, such as the one that presided over the Spanish growth in the boom years, will simply not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The setting is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And it would be wrong not to hear. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not only to renew the public deficit to 3% in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="30"> What we demand is much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And what it should not do in these circumstances is to deceive ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that the current turbulence happen to us a greater peace. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And we can seize the opportunity that we were given until the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that President Zapatero has also heard of this form and his double statement (the reforms promised after the meeting of the past Saturday with large firms and yesterday's announcement of new measures) suggests that, despite the criticism of Merkel, it opened the way to the thesis that we need to bring order to the house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line that Germany is there, and they do not seem to move. </seg>
<seg id="36"> And among the possibilities being considered, we cannot exclude that to abandon a monetary zone with too few countries. </seg>
<seg id="37"> And in this case, Germany we can always say that it had warned. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The peculiarity of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but they are emmagasinnées by components to make it difficult for their destruction in case of attack - is one of the main reasons for concern in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="7"> As the ambassador to Pakistan, Anne w. Patterson, lists in a report before the visit of the former national security adviser, James Jones: "The proximity of some nuclear facilities in the territory under Taliban attack, the dispersal of nuclear materials and the vulnerability of the transport of nuclear materials." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The large number of people involved in the nuclear arsenals and missile programs is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, as proliferating and a reason to maintain custody. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> All aspects linked to WikiLeaks and its founder, Julian Assange, form a complicated maze where it is difficult to have certainty on the facts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday Interpol issued a "red alert" to "locate and track the movements" of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Nevertheless, it is not a traditional order of arrest. </seg>
<seg id="7"> In addition, it is not new, otherwise date of 20 November. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And it has nothing to do with the filtration of more than a quarter million diplomatic documents of the United States but with accusations of sexual abuse that the Australian faces in Sweden. </seg>

</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The movement has outraged the lawyers to Assange, who yesterday published a letter denouncing the fact that the founder of WikiLeaks, 39, was willing to meet by video-conference questions from the Swedish authorities. </seg>
<seg id="14"> They also remind that Assange sought and obtained a permit to leave Sweden the prosecutor in his case, compared to the famous Lavrentiy Pavlovich Beria, head of the security of Stalin. </seg>

<seg id="18"> "If we can show that she was responsible for giving orders to American graduates that they spy on to the UN by violating international treaties that the United States has signed, she should resign," he said. </seg>

<seg id="5"> The President of the party is aware of the fact that his threat of resignation is not enough for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluis Carod-Rovira, but at the same time he knows that the influence of this sector is now so diluted as the liar and that it cannot give him headaches he had with other currents. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That is why the leader of Esquerra will try to win his critics with winks that allow it to shield up to municipal elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="22"> Huguet proposes that ERC liquid once and for all the Assembly as a mechanism of operation. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="19"> The evening ended with the intervention of the Spanish poet Luis García Montero also stressed "this is on the head of the writer." </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Green, but frankly skeptical. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The consumer is very little confidence in actors in sustainable development, but also fair trade marks and certifications écologisantes to guide their choices. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Worse, even if it is immersed in a media universe where the messages in favour of a more responsible consumption abound, there is a lack of credible information, he calls even brake to its commitment, said the barometer of responsible consumption, the first reading was delivered yesterday. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Even if they have increased the consumption of so-called socially responsible in 2010, Quebecers seem to give little credit to those who try to sell them. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Another finding: half of consumers doubt the reliability of official certifications affixed to the so-called fair trade products, but also the credibility of the products and brands displayed as eco-friendly, says the barometer. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the same vein, the speeches of politicians on this issue is taken seriously by only 14.6% of Quebecers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The information on responsible consumption seems to stimulate this section of the consumption by almost a third of the consumers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Indeed, the vacuum and the dubious nature of information would calm the ardour of 46% of consumers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, a third of Quebecers say they are also wary of the alleged performance of green products or services that seeks to put their hands. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> On another note, consumers were almost half in 2010 to have changed their habit and especially changed mark of one or more products to meet their conviction. </seg>
<seg id="14"> At 61%, they also encouraged purchases from merchants in their neighborhoods and the purchase of food grown in their region, the barometer. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new American diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks lift the veil on what the United States regards as the inferiority complex of Canadians to the Americans, but they betray the same time the sense of superiority of the latter to Canada. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Thus, American diplomats are surprised that every Canadian voter has not the Canada-U.S. relations in mind to vote and believe that the visit of President Obama has helped the conservative government to adopt its budget in 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the US embassy in Ottawa and Washington, over the public yesterday, offer more details as the substantive content to put in the tooth. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A cable dated September 22, 2008, is in full federal election campaign, recounts how the United States are not part of the issues discussed by political leaders. </seg>
<seg id="6"> To the astonishment of the American ambassador in Ottawa, David Wilkins. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr Wilkins offers some explanation for this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> "A Canadian inferiority complex almost inherent conditions perhaps the Canadian political leaders to talk about domestic issues of daily life rather than to focus this election on the United States (as in the campaign on free trade of 1988)," he writes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United States is therefore, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant in this election: ubiquitous, but potentially too threatening to talk about." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador has even less the "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political and economic relationship. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically, he believes, the ability of a candidate, party and even more of a party leader to manage this vital relationship should be a key factor that voters have in mind by going to vote." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Another expression of this sense of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22, 2009 by Terry Breese, chargé d'affaires in Ottawa, President Barack Obama on his first visit to Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your trip will help ensure the survival of the government in the vote of confidence in early February on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit in more than a decade because of a recovery plan for 30 to 40 billion dollars," writes Mr. Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere is it mentioned that the government had to extend the parliament before Christmas to avoid being overthrown by the coalition and the opposition parties made conditional on the quality of the recovery plan proposed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another communication, dated January 2008 and signed by Ambassador Wilkins, warned Washington of the increasingly negative image that drama series broadcast on CBC refer to the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador is concerned about emissions border, Little Mosque on the prairie, intelligence and H2O, in which there is little subtle references to Maher Arar, the "no-fly list" or abductions for interrogation by the CIA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another cable reports that, during their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton has asked his French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe was ready to welcome some prisoners at Guantánamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr KOUCHNER said yes, but on the basis of "case by case." </seg>
<seg id="19"> At the end of the meeting, it is written, "he presented a paper to the secretary of state of Omar Khadr, a Muslim 15 years of Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The secretary has agreed to review the file." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Finally, that tempers flare on the WikiLeaks site. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, a former adviser close to Stephen Harper, said on the CBC that the head of this mass exodus should be "assassinated." </seg>

<seg id="1"> A global plan to renovate the lighting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN has proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to obtain a reduction of greenhouse gas (GHG) which is almost one-third of the additional reduction that should be done to stabilize the global climate by 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan is in the wake of the large concrete projects that the UN hopes to adopt in Cancun to compensate for the lack of binding commitments by industrialized countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the plan filed yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs that monopolize still 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by bulbs, or better, by light-emitting diodes (LED or "led" in English), the bulk of the 1.8 billion tonnes (Gt) of GHG emissions on the planet to illuminate the humans would be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Lighting is responsible for 8% of global emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the cars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen last year, the major emitters, such as the United States, China, Europe and Others, including Canada, are engaged in voluntary reduction plans that should increase overall emissions of 53 to 49. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But it will subtract from this assessment still 5 GT by 2020 to stabilize the climate to 2 degrees centigrade in order to prevent it from becoming out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of the energy is dissipated as heat and the rest, 5%, the light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With bulbs, energy expenditure is reduced by 75% and with the new bulbs led, reduces the need for energy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The bulbs last an average of 6,000 to 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new LED bulbs, such as those that launched the manufacturer Philips this week - the company has also participated in the study of the UN - have a life expectancy of 25,000 hours and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the economy with a plan that would apply to 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> These new bulbs can also work with rheostats In addition to emit very little heat. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they do not contain any mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several experts have shown reservations about the bulbs because they contain mercury and that must be disposed of as hazardous waste, which is not always possible in developing countries, unless the manufacturers are in place. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But, says the report, the main source of mercury emissions on the planet is not the bulb, but rather the coal-fired power plants, which emit a lot of mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the United States alone, these plants emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report details the gains that would each country through this international program. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For example, Indonesia would save $1 billion dollars a year in purchases of electricity and eight million tonnes of CO2, the equivalent of 3.5 thermal power plants whose construction would cost 2.5 billion. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The UN secretary-general, Ban Ki-moon, called for the release "without delay" the results of the presidential election in Ivory Coast, after the expiry of the deadline. </seg>
<seg id="3"> "The secretary general stressed the need for the Independent Electoral Commission to complete its work and to announce provisional results without further delay," said a spokesman for the head of the UN. " </seg>
<seg id="4"> "It calls on all parties and institutions to act responsibly and to refrain from any action until the announcement of provisional results." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="5"> Despite pressure from some foreign governments, the electoral commission has missed the deadline of midnight Wednesday without publishing the results, three days after the election on Sunday. </seg>
<seg id="6"> About 40 minutes before the expiry of the deadline, the President of the CIS had said on television that the Committee "continued to work" to announce the results. </seg>

<seg id="12"> Alassane Ouattara, a man who denies any link with the former rebels, said it was "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and called on Gbagbo to respect them, but it did not go so far as to claim victory. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> For more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, the fate of Clotilde Reiss, the young French researcher arrested in Iran for spying, "held opinion in suspense in France, put on alert, and increased the deterioration of relations between Paris and Tehran. </seg>
<seg id="3"> All under the watchful eyes of diplomats from the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal some of this crisis. </seg>
<seg id="5"> They describe how the Elysée explained his strategy to the Americans, up to give advice for the treatment of their own crises "hostages" in Iran (A small group of hikers). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> They show how French officials have sought to convince Washington that the release of the young had not had for the release of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian detained in France and wanted by the U.S. justice for smuggling of materials for the benefit of the Iranian nuclear program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Finally, they put under a harsh light the way in which the French Presidency has sought to manipulate the media to give credence to the idea that the Syrian president, Bashar al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In reality, it was nothing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A diplomatic telegram written on August 12, 2009 in Paris is titled "Iran: French comments on how to handle cases of hostages." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The advisor to the palace for Strategic Affairs, François Richier, accompanied by the Director of the Quai d'Orsay to North Africa and the Middle East, Patrice Paoli, interview with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> They explain the French method. </seg>
<seg id="12"> They advise Americans to do the same to repatriate their own nationals held in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Make Noise," they say, "Hammer" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate release." </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is in order to embarrass the Iranian regime, sensitive to its image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "Do it all the more the Iranians ask you not to do it." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because past attempts at discussions by discreet channels, "the silence will not solve anything," The Iranians are "masters in delaying tactics." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr. Richier added that the arrest of foreigners is "a tactic familiar: the taking of hostages for political blackmail." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He announced that the release from prison of Clotilde Reiss (who will speak on August 16, when she takes refuge in the Embassy of France) "will require the payment to the Iranians of a large sum of money" (230 000 Euros). </seg>
<seg id="19"> And he said that the élysée anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon that "will worsen." </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Iranians could "in the near future to stop another of some 1,800 French citizens living in Iran," he said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> August 28, 2009. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Clotilde Reiss is out of prison for 12 days, but remains blocked in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, including the US demand for extradition for illegal trafficking of sensitive electronic equipment to Iran, is released in Paris, on the decision of a judge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The US embassy, as many observers wondered about this troubling coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington, which tracks the clandestine networks of acquisition of equipment for the nuclear program, the enlargement of Majid Khakavand is bad news. </seg>
<seg id="26"> France has accepted a bargain? </seg>
<seg id="27"> The release of the Iranian against that of the French? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> In a new interview with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4, François Richier ensures that this is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Elysée Palace, he said, not only "completely taken by surprise by the decision of the judge," but sought to oppose it. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "There were heated exchanges between the French Presidency and the Minister of Justice" (at the time, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot go back on the decision," he observes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Mr. Richier also wants to demonstrate that Majid Kakavand remains under the "closely" monitoring of the French intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The adviser to the Elysee dials a telephone number, hangs up, then informed the US diplomat that the Iranian "is currently located in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysée is sparing no effort, through press releases and "leaks" in the media, to believe that the Syrian President Bashar al-Assad is an "important" and "influential" role of "mediator." </seg>
<seg id="34"> Americans observe this activity not without irony, and find that the handling is bearing fruit as several press articles reflected the official French version. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> A telegram dated August 25, 2009 evokes "The media blitz' French officials." </seg>
<seg id="36"> What is the basis of "gratitude" expressed to Mr Assad, asked the embassy in Paris. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "Despite their statements full of praise, French officials acknowledge privately that they have only a vague notion of what the Syrians have actually done." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The paper then examines the reasons that led the Elysée palace to pay in this fiction. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The intense effort of communication "aimed at validating Sarkozy's policy of opening to Syria," he said. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A policy launched in 2008, which "had been seen by many critics in France and abroad, as premature and unwarranted." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> In "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks to "demonstrate to Syria what it can attract by playing a constructive role in the region." </seg>
<seg id="42"> The aim is also to "sow the seeds of discord between Syria and Iran." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The U.S. Embassy knows a good source. </seg>
<seg id="44"> On August 11, François Richier entrusted him: "Of course, we do not know if the Syrians have done anything." </seg>
<seg id="45"> "But we thanked them anyway." </seg>

<seg id="3"> Although a relative, relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of European government bonds has provided grist to the mill of Governments and the ECB. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="5"> To start the GSP, the government announced a capital of 4 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="6"> In the theoretical, it is this sum which will then allow the GSP to borrow on the markets a share of the funding of its double loop. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Today, it finally to the first additions. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Finance Act 2010, examined in the Finance Committee of the National Assembly this morning, contains the devices to find the beginning of this money. </seg>
<seg id="9"> They are two: the creation of a special tax of equipment and an increase in the tax offices in Ile-de-France. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The first one reads in the text of the bill, article 15, is "for the benefit of the Public Corporation of Greater Paris." </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is encrypted: "The proceeds of this tax is $117 million euros per year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The second is a redevelopment of a tax on offices that already exists "in order to modernize, to the product and allocate the increase to the Society of Greater Paris." </seg>

<seg id="15"> It is not encrypted in the text. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It is far from the 4 billion. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It is clear that these resources are in addition to the 4 billion euros of capital that will be mobilized by the state and brought to the Society of Greater Paris as the project," read in the explanatory statement. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The WikiLeaks has a double value. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On the one hand, it is a scandal, a scandal that appears as scandal in the hypocrisy that governs relations between states, citizens and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On the other, it announces major changes at the international level, and foreshadows a future dominated by the regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But in order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of Wikileaks, it is confirmation of the fact that every record by a Secret Service (of any nation) is composed exclusively of press clippings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The "extraordinary" American revelations about the sexual habits of Berlusconi only report what for months could be read in any newspaper (except those which Berlusconi owns), and the profile of Khadafi was long for the cabaret artists to sketch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule that the secret files must be that new already known is essential to the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go into a bookstore to esoteric publications, you will see that each book repeats (on the Holy Grail, the mystery of Rennes-le-Chateau, the Templars or the Rosicrucians) exactly what was already written in previous works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> And not only because the author of occult texts do not like to do original research (does not know where to look for news on the non-existent), but because those who devote themselves to the occult believe only what they already know, and reconfirms what they had learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Ditto for the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The informant is lazy, lazy (or limited) The head of the secret services (otherwise it might be, I know, editor of Libération), which is as true as it recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The top secret information on Berlusconi that the US embassy in Rome sent to the State Department were the same as those that Newsweek published the week before. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> So why the revelations about these issues have made so much noise? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On one hand, they say that any person, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the heads of state can call or take a plane to meet for dinner, have lost their diplomatic and, except for some small exercises representation, transformed into centres of espionage. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any viewer of films knows that, and it is only by hypocrisy that pretending to ignore it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the fact of repeating publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and serves to put in a bad light American diplomacy. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Secondly, the idea that a hacker can capture the most secret secrets of the most powerful country in the world is a significant blow to the prestige of the State Department. </seg>
<seg id="20"> As the scandal is not in crisis victims as the "torturers." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But let us come to the very nature of what happened. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Once, at the time of Orwell, one could conceive any power as a big brother who controlled every gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The prophecy had completely since, that can control every movement through the phone, every transaction, the Hotel visited, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the victim of the eye of power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But when shows, as it happens now, that even the crypts of the secrets of power cannot escape the control of a hacker, the report ceases to be unidirectional and becomes circular. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power control every citizen, but every citizen, or at least the hacker - elected as the citizen - can know all the secrets of power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How a power that no longer has the possibility to keep its own secrets can hold? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said already, that a true secret is an empty (and empty secret will never be revealed); it is true, also, that any knowledge about the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed a secret of secret, because in the public domain, but reveal, as did WikiLeaks, that the secrets of Hillary Clinton were empty secrets means to remove any power. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks has done no harm to Sarkozy and Merkel, but was too big to Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> What will be the consequences of this injury inflicted on a very powerful? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is clear that in the future, states will no longer put any information reserved - it would publish it on a poster on the corner. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is equally clear that with current technology, it is vain to hope to maintain confidential reports by telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing easier than to discover if and when a head of state moved by plane and contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How can be maintained in the future the private and reserved reports? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know that, for the moment, my prediction is science fiction and is therefore romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials who move in the uncontrollable routes, carriers of messages learned by heart or, at most, hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information will be stored in a single copy in drawers locked: Basically, the attempted espionage Watergate has had less success than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the opportunity to write that technology is now crab, i.e. backwards. </seg>
<seg id="37"> A century after the wireless telegraph revolutionized communications, the Internet has restored a telegraph on son (telephone). </seg>
<seg id="38"> The video (analog) had allowed the researchers to explore a film step by step, by going forwards and backwards and discovering all the secrets of the Assembly, but now CD (digital) only allow to jump to chapter by chapter, that is to say by Macroportions. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With high-speed trains, one goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, while in flight, and that it includes, it takes three and a half hours. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is not extraordinary that the policy and communications back to the horse-drawn carriages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A final observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In the past, the press was trying to understand what was going on in the secret of embassies. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Now, it is the embassies seeking confidential information to the press. </seg>
