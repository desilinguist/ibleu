<seg id="1"> United States: repetition is mother of wisdom </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It becomes even comic, conscientious effort with which Barack Obama, President to the reputation of wise, reproduces the strategy of his predecessor on the Afghan question, he considered himself very simple. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> When he eventually leave sweat its doctrine so eagerly awaited, it emerged that he had Recopied carbon paper since the Iraq scenario of Bush three years ago. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Not content to use in the text several times the expression &quot;as in Iraq&quot;, he has not hesitated, that is, to use the title of the January 2007 speech by Bush as the title of his own speech: &quot;a new road before&quot; </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> At the same time, he has personally criticised the idea of Bush to send new reinforcements in Iraq consumed by the civil war as &quot;irresponsible and a disastrous decision in its consequences.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="6"> The following months have however shown that Bush ’ s strategy, which stemmed from recommendations of the campaigns commanders, was the only possible and likely success to the point that the newspapers at the moment do not speak at all of Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="7"> This has not improved the Bush reputation, objectively speaking, it has left to his successor a final situation much more favourable than we might hope. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Barack Obama hope that in Afghanistan, the miracle will happen </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> They are again the commanders of campaigns that have requested an increase of military contingent, including the Afghan operation commander, General Stanley Mccristal, who has severely criticised the reluctance of the White House despite the habits of subordination. </seg>
<seg id="10"> He asked 40 000 men in order to make the situation more favourable. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The President has hesitated for three months but in the absence of a better alternative, at least it has defrauded the general 10 000 soldiers. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He has managed to extricate the promise of additional 5 000 from the Europe, even if there were over 10 000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> This causes the most problems throughout the strategy of Obama seems to be its intention to withdraw military forces from Afghanistan within 18 months and to complete this whole process by three years. The doctrine of Obama brings more questions than it answers. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Many doubt the fact that an increase of half will bring the same fruit that progress in Iraq. </seg>
<seg id="15"> In spite of fratricidal wars in recent years, the Iraqi society is relatively well organised and its leaders honour the agreements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Afghan situation stands by the exact opposite - we cannot rely on person and no treaty is respected. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In these conditions, difficult to prepare Afghan security forces, used to change leader from day to day depending on what suits them. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The political institutions, although based formally remain that the smokescreen behind which will proliferate patriarchal ethnic relations. </seg>
<seg id="19"> It is particularly complex balancing the interests of various ethnic groups given the lack of clarity about the reports, which are still complicated by the Pakistani and Iranian influences. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Even the foundation of a &quot;state quick to act &apos;, which is the aim of the operation, does not seem to be very real. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The time horizon of the Obama strategy makes perplexed by his proactive. </seg>
<seg id="22"> In the past eight years, the situation in Afghanistan has deteriorated and is currently on the brink of chaos. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Only a heart purely romantic and out of reality can be persuaded that the small soldiers sent in the clamour of war in view of their &quot;quick return to the home&quot; will bring a real miracle. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> From a political point of view, fix a date for the withdrawal of troops is purely irresponsible because the Taliban will see us as the indirect admission of defeat. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The last NATO summit showed that the will of Europeans to participate in military operations in Afghanistan is moving towards the negative. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The European political or do not want to explain to their electorate in what the security in Germany or Italy is linked to a war in the mountains of the Hindu Kush. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Another factor capable of radically alter the situation is the development of events related to Iran. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If the situation continues to deteriorate and the reinforced sanctions do not have effects on the Iranians, the Americans find themselves faced with the very difficult issue of a resolution of the problem by the use of military force. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It must be addressed by example when, according to Obama, America will the victorious withdrawal of troops in Afghanistan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Each solution of this kind will however a dramatic reversal of the Afghan situation. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The only patch for Obama is the fact that it remains three years until the presidential elections and therefore there is still enough time to working on a new strategy, if it proves to be a flop. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Discovery Czech: a substance that operates on the HIV virus &quot;robust&quot; also </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A team of scientists Czechs and Germans to test new combinations which can slow the spread of HIV in the body. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The main advantage of the substance improved is that it is also on the viruses which have already developed an immunity to medicines. </seg>
<seg id="4"> This reality is, in some cases, over the fact that the combination is not as intensely on common variation of virus as well as some drugs already available. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is not possible to cure the AIDS at the moment. </seg>
<seg id="6"> We can, however, extend the life of patients through a mixture of drugs to prevent the spread of HIV in the body. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, their use causes a series of side effects. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Of more repression of this proliferation has the effect development of what are known as resistant viruses on which drugs no longer have effect. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The work of the experts of the three institutions, the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic, the Všcht Prague and the University of Heidelberg opens the way to a way to the resistance of the virus. </seg>
<seg id="10"> They have shown that substances known Metalocarboranes act on the protein responsible for the proliferation of the HIV virus. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The Metalocarboranes are an assembly of boron, hydrogen, carbon and cobalt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> This combination blocks the development of the virus in a different way to all drugs used until now and that is why they could overcome the problem of resistance. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The work of researchers to discover new substances &quot;improved&quot;, on the basis of their knowledge of the molecular mechanics of their routes into the protein of the virus. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The Metalocarboranes have a single three-dimensional structure: two cages to multiple walls are formed by the boron, hydrogen and carbon atoms and connected by a metal atom, in this case the cobalt. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A traitor and resistant virus. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The HIV protease is a protein of the HIV virus which is essential to the life cycle of the virus. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Without the division of HIV virus caused by the HIV protease there would be no birth of mature infectious particles of virus. </seg>
<seg id="18"> If we stop the HIV protease, will be also the spread of the virus in the patient&apos;s body, explain the researchers in a press release issued by the Institute of organic chemistry and biochemistry of the Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In their works published in the scientific journal Journal of Medicinal Chemistry, scientists describe a series of combinations where two pairs of cages (see table) are linked by a short link organic, which is then modified. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> A somewhat smaller, but more reliable. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The effectiveness of this series of substances on HIV protease was tested in tubes and its variants resistant, obtained from patients infected with HIV. </seg>
<seg id="22"> On the current version of the enzyme, the effect of Metalocarboranes is not as strong as on drugs clinical, however it is not diminishing on versions resistant against which current medications are often ineffective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The Metalocarboranes, with their unique mechanism of action and other properties such as chemical and biological stability, low toxicity and the possibility of other chemical changes are therefore of interesting food combinations to examine more towards the development of effective drugs against HIV, says Pavlína Řezáčová, director of the Laboratory for Structural Biology of the Institute of Organic Chemistry and Biochemistry and Molecular Genetics Institute of the Academy of Sciences. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Nečas warns that the positions of the ODS and social democrats in relation to the problem of public deficits are diametrically opposed. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The Chamber of Deputies ratified Wednesday the budget for the year 2010, however, with amendments to tune of 12 billion kronor included by the left. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The House has increased the money for the salaries of civil servants, the operation of social services and direct payments to farmers. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Government&apos;s plea to proposals from the Social Democrats was the fact that they increased indirectly the budget deficit. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The Czech Republic should manage a deficit of 163 billion kronor. </seg>

<seg id="19"> If Fischer decides to continue the fight against the budget deficit, Nečas estimates that the representatives of Čssd, which have imposed the budget changes, do not have their place in the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The Prime Minister should also make clear that he will resign if the House ratify other laws increasing the deficit such as those affecting the health insurance, pensions, or the reform of the Act on services. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Topolánek: ministers appointed by the ODS are not in issue. </seg>

</p>

<seg id="25"> Nečas stressed that if Fischer decides to give its resignation to fight against the amount of the public finance deficit, &quot;it is entirely logical and correct that it is based on the left-wing majority which is currently in the House.&quot; </seg>
<seg id="26"> This said, it must not expect to support and tolerance of Democrats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> I have not thought and once it will be on the agenda then I will dedicate, said since the Chamber to journalists, the Minister of Defence Martin Barták, elected to government by the Democrats. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="29"> The ODS was reversed at the request of the Prime Minister. </seg>
<seg id="30"> Nečas stressed at the same time that the ODS would probably voted Wednesday against the amended budget if he had not specifically asked the Democratic members to allow the budget vote. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> We do not have the feeling of being orphans, it is no small children, he responded to the question of whether the ODS had not suffered accusations from the President of the party in the House or in the country in negotiating the budget. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Some readers will be attracted by this new book, the author&apos;s latest book fan, &quot;why the French do not like the headscarf&quot; (2006), elegant and well documented study on a problem that has divided and concerned the country for 15 years and whose effects are still felt today. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Mr. Bowen ’ s latest book is a much broader and more ambitious. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Good anthropologist, he does not only wishes to know what politicians and the media say about Islam in France, but what is currently happening in the country. </seg>
<seg id="8"> He spent many months in mosques, schools and institutes provide now in France, Quem. Bozen calls &quot;spaces&quot; for 5m-6m Muslims of Muslims. </seg>
<seg id="9"> He knows very well listen and reproduce the debates between teachers and students on the issues that concern them most. </seg>
<seg id="10"> A Muslim should marry in a mosque or City Hall (or both)? </seg>
<seg id="11"> The evolution and the rights of homosexuals should be taught to young Muslims? </seg>
<seg id="12"> A Muslim woman can marry a non-Muslim? </seg>
<seg id="13"> A Muslim can use a banking system based on interests for a loan? </seg>
<seg id="14"> These are practical problems, he says, which are the daily lot, rather than the tragedies policies which concern the media. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The author identifies a new generation of imams, teachers and intellectuals, all unknown to the general public, except perhaps Tariq Ramadan, an Arab Muslim born in Switzerland. </seg>
<seg id="16"> This new generation trying to open the debate on how to be a good Muslim and a good citizen in a modern secular society. </seg>
<seg id="17"> They do not push the debate until the end. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Lesconservateurs do not believe in the idea of a French or European Islam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> The intellectuals and activists who have been interviewed by Mr. Bowen are in general agreement with their counterparts lawyers of a Sunni Islam purist associated with Saudi Arabia which of our days, are a small part of Muslims in Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> M Bowen believe that the values of Muslims and the secularism of French might be compatible. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But a compromise can only be achieved with the efforts of each side. </seg>
<seg id="22"> He wonders how much the French politicians (and the intellectual elite guardian if virulent of secularism) are really committed to pluralism. </seg>
<seg id="23"> According to him, Muslims have not been spoiled, compared to the Catholics, Protestants and Jews who also had to make compromises historic with the secular republicanism. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Rather than a growing pragmatism, it detects a &quot;narrowness of key values&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Saturday, Pakistani authorities have identified organization supposed to prepare a conspiracy to send five men of Northern Virginia in Afghanistan in order to kill American troops, saying they hoped that this case would disassemble an important network of terrorists who plundering the Internet in search of young men radicalised. </seg>

<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But a representative of a secret service Pakistanis who has been informed of the matter said Saturday that Saifullah had failed to convince al-Qaeda commanders that these men were not involved in the plot of the CIA to infiltrate the terrorist network. </seg>
<seg id="6"> As a result, they have been isolated for days in the eastern city of Sargodha, far mountains banned northeast become a refuge of terrorism. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The federal report last week on mathematics achievement has made a good news for the public schools in Washington D.C. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Although the district is still far behind, the report shows that the grade 4 and grade 5 (Cm1-cm2) are much greater progress in the two previous years in cities such as Atlanta, Chicago and New York. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> But the latest figures show the National Assessment of Educational Progress (evaluation of progress education) is the persistent gap between the results of African-Americans and whites, on both the local and national plans. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The average results of white children Grade 4 (PO1) to Washingtond.c. have increased, over the past two years, 262 to 270 (on a scale of 500), but those of their classmates African-American increased by only three points, 209 to 212. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The success has in fact increased gap between 2007 and 2009, from 53 to 58 points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The progress of African Americans in Grade 8 (4th) remains generally constant, only a point, from 245 to 244. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The mean score of White has not been included in the results of the tests because the sample was not important enough. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The view of a period of six years is not encouraging. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In 2003, the gap between blacks and whites in Grade 4 class (PO1), when the first report NAEP district was published, was 60 points (262 to 202). </seg>
<seg id="11"> Although the results obtained by the children in both groups increased during this period, the difference is only reduced to 58 points. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The last week, some advocates in the district have expressed concern that the increase celebrated by the director of education institutions Michelle A. Rhee and Mayor Adrian M. Fenty (Democrat) were powered by the white students who were already good elements. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> This would mean that we have raised the aggregate in considering the elements at the top of the scale, which is problematic and embarrassing, &quot;said Jeff Smith, director of DC Voice, a non-profit group that defends the equality in education district. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> I do not immediately for one or two points, &quot;said Kwame R. Brown (related Democrat), member of the D.C. Council and whose daughter is in Grade 4, and Eaton Elementary (elementary school). </seg>
<seg id="15"> Often critical of management style of Rhee, Brown said that the message of test results is that middle schools (colleges) of the city desperately need attention. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Really, you still want to see positive signs and I respect it. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But fear is that we do not spend enough time and energy to our middle schools (collèges). </seg>
<seg id="18"> Rhee has said that the District should continue to find better ways to meet the needs of students in difficulty. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This autumn, for example, some teachers have been trained to use a new method of reading, the Wilson reading system, for children in classes end of primary and early college that have not incorporated the bases of reading earlier in their school and is behind in their peers. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Every day, the Mathematics curriculum, for kindergarten classes (kindergarten to grade 6 (6th) focuses on the Games and the real-life experiences, such as they have been implemented in the district by former responsible Clifford Janey, who must also be credited for the progress of the NAEP reported last week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> I simply believe that we must continue to work to provide better interventions to these students to below the level of the class, said Rhee. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Others were of the view that the results of the NAEP raise the question of whether Rhee can continue to raise the overall results of the system while providing the money and resources for schools with less good results in order to reduce the gap. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> That is a dilemma for Michelle Rhee, said Bruce Fuller, a trainer of teaching at the University of California at Berkeley who is studying the results of the tests of cities. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The conventional political solution is to devote your resources and management reforms to schools located in the poorest neighborhoods of Washington. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Also targeting can have political repercussions that hinder this important program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> But the problem, of course, is that as the other superintendent of schools, to try to use the middle class white and black. </seg>
<seg id="27"> We focus to ensure the development of a system of good schools. </seg>
<seg id="28"> We must strengthen our neighbourhoods schools so that all families, regardless of where they are from, are confident that their children can obtain an excellent public education. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Janey, now superintendent of schools of Newark, said in an interview this week, that one of the essential elements to reduce the gap of success is the duration of traditional public school, now 180 days in the District of Washington, to be in competition with charter schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> It must obtain about 200 days to have the strength to change, said Janey, who has come to an agreement with the union of teachers last year for 185 days, that it considers a &quot;starting point&quot; for a further increase in the next contract. </seg>

<seg id="9"> The University of Pennsylvania was the seventh that visiting children during their voyage of discovery of three days and now, they had completely integrated the message: the question is not whether you go to university: </seg>
<seg id="10"> The question is where. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Although this question remains largely for the large number of American children born to parents Hispanic migrants who have left the school where became parents to adolescence, they are also from hundreds of thousands to benefit of university education that will enable them to enter the middle class. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, &quot;Hispanic&quot; second generation &quot;on Cinqpoursuit academic secondary school -- a notable success if we consider that both of their parents immigrants, most from Mexico or Central America, came to us without having completed high school. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Their success is important, the researchers say, they open the way to future generations that will play an important role in the country&apos;s workforce. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The researchers studying wings say that they have a natural affinity with the school and an innate need to succeed. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Many are also those whose parents set high targets to their children and find the means to compensate for their lack of familiarity with American schools. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The 10 agreements reached by the Iraqi Ministry of Oil with the foreign oil companies suggest that oil companies from China, Russia and Europe are about to play a major role in the restoration of the oil industry of Iraq, invalidated by decades of war and sanctions. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The American companies were, in some cases, disadvantaged because of their rivals, in particular the Chinese and other energy companies controlled by a government, whose labour costs were significantly lower and who were more willing to take risks because they had not accountable to shareholders. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> It seems that an American missile, which hit along the border with Afghanistan has killed one of the organizers of al-Qaeda&apos;s operations, this week, said Friday U.S. authorities of counter-intelligence. </seg>
<seg id="3"> If the information is confirmed, it would be the second deadly attack against a terrorist leaders this autumn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Saleh Al-somali was one of two Arab men suspected to have been killed by a pair of missiles launched in their car, Tuesday, near the city of Miran Shah, in North Waziristan, according to US sources and Pakistani authorities in the region. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It was completely impossible for local authorities to ascertain the identity of the victims, but the two representatives counter-terrorism Americans have given evidence not specified that Somali was part of deaths. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Somali was described as one of the responsible military of al-Qaeda organizers who led the terrorist operations of the group outside the region Afghanistan-pakistan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Its role was to organize plots around the world, &quot;said one of the authorities who wanted to remain anonymous, citing the sensitive nature of the air strikes inside Pakistani territory. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Given its central role, this included probably conspiracies of attacks against the United States and Europe. </seg>
<seg id="12"> He followed the strategic guidance of the leaders of al-Qaida and has translated into action plans for possible terrorist attacks. </seg>

</p>
<p>

<seg id="3"> The departure of Eide comes at a time when the Obama administration has decided to send an additional 30,000 soldiers in Afghanistan. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The UN envoy said that he supported this increase but he expressed concern about the timetable for a withdrawal of US troops beginning in 18 months and that would force other NATO governments to withdraw their forces. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> We need to accelerate the development of our security forces in Afghanistan, send the right signal to Afghans and remind them that they can have confidence in the international community, &quot;Eide said in a telephone interview from Kabul. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Our commitment must be long-term. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The Norwegian diplomat has also urged the US and other military powers to increase the number of international civil servants helping political transition in Afghanistan. </seg>

<seg id="14"> According to the representatives of the UN, Ban has already begun to seek a replacement. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The representatives claim that the name Staffan di Mistura has been cited; it is a citizen Italo-Swiss recently chaired a UN mission in Baghdad and Jean-Marie Guéhenno, a Frenchman who has previously led the UN peacekeeping operations. </seg>

<seg id="17"> Eide denied these allegations but he stated that the accusations of Galbraith -- which has been thanked -- &quot;have undermined the mission because there already had a good dose of scepticism as regards the international observation of elections&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Eide said that it had proposed the appointment of a civilian representative to coordinate the rescue of U.S. forces in Afghanistan. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Gates: Iran must undergo additional sanctions </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The defense secretary, Robert M. Gates said Friday that world powers would soon impose &quot;significant additional sanctions&quot; on Iran because of its inability to engage in talks on the nuclear ambitions. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Gates, speaking at a Roomful of 300 American soldiers in northern Iraq, during a visit to a week in war zones in Afghanistan and Iraq, has played down the possibility of military action against the Islamic Republic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> There is no good option in Iran, he said, in response to the question of a soldier on the possibility of such an outcome. ¨ </seg>
<seg id="5"> One of the things I am the most weight is that if I have learned one thing in Iraq over the past six years, it is the unpredictable inherent to the war. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The Obama administration considers a set of sanctions that target Iran&apos;s political and military elite, but Gates has reported that some of these sanctions could also affect the Iranians in the street. </seg>
<seg id="7"> He said that a &quot;set of incentives and punishments&quot; might be needed to persuade the Iranian government that it would in fact less good security with nuclear weapons &quot;because&quot; people suffer much of these sanctions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Friday, in a statement of the White House spokesman, Robert Gibbs, administration has joined the European leaders in a warning that Iran will face consequences &quot;probable&quot; if it does not bring its nuclear program in full compliance with the UN Security Council and its Monitoring Agency, the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The Iran continues to say that he wants to develop its nuclear experience only in a peaceful purposes. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In talks in Geneva on October 1st, he indicated that it would resume the dialogue on the reduction of its nuclear programme and agreed to give up a significant part of its storage of enriched uranium, in exchange for fuel desperately needed for a medical research reactor. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The administration has pushed such an agreement, develop a confidence on both sides and to save time for negotiations. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Since then, Iran appears to be distant from the attempts to agreement, in part, the experts say, because the Iranian leadership is divided on whether or not engage with the US. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Frankly, in my view, the stiffening of Iran with some of the proposals of the international community for which they had given their agreement in early October, has led the international community, including the Russians and the Chinese, to join on what they had not considered important, in terms of additional sanctions against the Iranians, said Gates. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The President Obama has set a December 31 deadline for Iran to respond to proposals, before it turned to other options, including the continuation of what Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton once called &apos;sanctions&apos;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> In a statement Thursday in New York, the Mission of Iran to the United Nations has criticised what it calls &quot;baseless allegations&quot; of some members of the Security Council on the nuclear activities of Iran and stated that she agreed to continue talks with the United States and five other world powers, in order to obtain a long-term satisfactory solution &quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Gates, who was returning to Washington later Friday, met in the morning, the Iraqi Prime Minister, Nouri al-Maliki, before getting on the plane for the oil rich region of Kurdish Derencontrer those responsible troops in Kirkuk, Kurdish and Irbil. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The persisting tensions between the Kurds and Arab majority in Iraq, particularly on the borders, property rights and the sharing of income. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Gates has urged both sides to reduce the conflict potential in order to avoid any delays of US plans to reduce the number of American troops, 115 000 to 50 000 before the end of August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Gates also want to calm the anxiety of the Kurds on the pending withdrawal. The American authorities have cited Gates saying to Massoud Barzani, president of the Kurdistan Regional Government: &quot;We preserve your security, prosperity and autonomy within a unified Iraq&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="20"> We will not abandon you. &quot; </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Wang Weijia and her husband grew up surrounded by poster of propaganda lecturing, &quot;Mother Earth is too tired to accommodate more children&quot; and &quot;one more baby, this is a grave in more&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They have learned the lesson so well that the government of Shanghai, alarmed by the lack of birth rate of their city and the ageing of the population, have radically changed direction this summer and began to encourage young couples to have more than one child; their reaction was instant and firm: never. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> We have already given all our time and energy to a single child. </seg>
<seg id="5"> There is no second, says Wang, 31, director of human resources and has a son of 8 months. </seg>
<seg id="6"> More than 30 years after the introduction of the policy of the child single in China, creating two generations of children unique notoriously with good cheeks and spoiled, dubbed &quot;little emperors&quot;, a population crisis threatening. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> According to the UN, the average birth rate has dropped 1.8 children per couple compared to six when the policy was implemented. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The distribution of the population, but it is expected that the number of residents aged 60 and more explode, 16.7 per cent of the population in 2020 to 31.1% in 2050. This figure is well above the overall average of 20 percent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> This imbalance is even worse in cities rich coastal having a highly educated population, such as Shanghai. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The last year, those aged 60 and over accounted for almost 22 per cent of the population of residents registered in Shanghai, while the birth rate was less than one child per couple. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Xie Lingli, director of the Shanghai Municipal Population and Family Planning Commission (Commission of the Shanghai municipal population and family planning) has said that the fertile pairs must have babies to &apos;help to reduce the proportion of the aging population and to prevent a labor shortage in the future &quot;. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Shanghai is on the point of becoming &quot;too old - but not as rich, however – that the developed countries such as Japan and Sweden&quot;, she said. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A incremental mitigation </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Written in the Constitution in 1978, the single China&apos;s one-child policy is to this day, without doubt, the most controversial obligation introduced by the communist government. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The couples who contravene this policy may have to pay huge fines -- up to three times their annual income -- and of discrimination in the workplace. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The Chinese authorities have attributed to the police on duty to help the country avoid a dangerous trend for its natural resources, while lawyers have denounced the abuse of human rights in the implementation of this policy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In rural areas, some representatives of the Authority have forced pregnant women a second child to abortion. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, many couples have had recourse to Sex-selective abortions leading to a ratio boys girls abnormally high. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In recent years, the authorities responsible for the population gradually softened their position on the policy of the child single. </seg>
<seg id="20"> In 2004, they provided more of exceptions to the rule -- including for residents of cities, members of ethnic minorities and the cases in which the man and the woman are already children -- and 2007, they have softened many of their slogans hard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Qiao Xiaochun, Professor at the Institute of Population Research (Institute of Population Research), at Peking University, said that the authorities of the central Government have recently discussed even more radical changes, such as allowing couples to have two children if one of the partners is an only child. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> In July, Shanghai became the first Chinese city to launch an aggressive campaign to encourage births. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In no time, the posters to encourage families to have only one child were replaced by copies of regulations retailer who has the right to have a second child and how to apply for authorization. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The city government has dispatched family planning officials and volunteers to meet couples at home, and slide of prospectus in their door. </seg>
<seg id="25"> He also promised to provide psychological and financial advice to those who would like to have more than one child. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> According to the head of family planning, the response was disappointing. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Disappointing response </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Although officials in a rural town on the outskirts of Shanghai say they have seen an increase in requests for files of couples wanting a second child after the launch of the campaign, the more urban district reported that there was no change. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The municipality of Huinan, with a population of 115 000 inhabitants, for example, still receiving four to five requests per month. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The responsible for Shanghai, disappointed, say that despite the campaign, the number of births in the city, in 2010, is still expected to be approximately 165 000 -- slightly higher to 2009 but lower in 2008. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Feng Juying, head of family planning committee in the municipality of Caolu Shanghai, said that financial considerations are probably the main reason why many people do not want to have more children. </seg>
<seg id="32"> They want to provide their first child, she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> Yang Jiawei, 27 years and his wife, Liu archery, 26, have said that they would dearly have two children and that they are legally entitled. </seg>
<seg id="34"> But as many Chinese, they have only the minimum health insurance and life insurance provided by the government. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> Without a social protection, they say, the decision would be irresponsible. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> The Western mistakenly see that a single child policy is a rights issue, said Yang, a construction engineer whose wife is seven months pregnant with the couple&apos;s first child. </seg>
<seg id="37"> It is true, we stole the chance of having more than one child. </seg>
<seg id="38"> But the problem is not only the law. </seg>
<seg id="39"> It is money. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Of other couples cite psychological reasons for their reluctance. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> Wang, human resources manager, said she wanted only a single child because it itself. &quot;We were the centre of the family and used all the world cares.&quot; </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> Even a child only requires a lot of time with his parents, he says. </seg>
<seg id="47"> A mother must abandon at least two years of her social life. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The climate conference, sponsored by the UN -- characterized so far by assignments disorganized and mutual recriminations -- is back under the spotlight Friday, due to the publication of a document outlining the ambitious reductions in greenhouse gases over the next 40 years, with the industrialized nations supporting most of the burden, in the coming years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The text that could provide the basis for a final political agreement to regulate greenhouse gases, &quot;said the remaining obstacles, as he informed the path to take. </seg>
<seg id="4"> But it was seen as an important step forward in the negotiations that lack of time, with over 100 world leaders arriving in the next week in Copenhagen. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Prepared by a special working group of the UN, the text does not say how rich countries would give poor to support the global warming, the short and long term. </seg>
<seg id="6"> And it offers a wide range of options for key issues, including how the developed economies and the emerging economies could reduce their production of carbon and what would be the upper limit of the increase in the global temperature that those responsible would be willing to tolerate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> It gives great flexibility in the process, &quot;said John Coequyt, representative Àwashington of the Sierra Club. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Michael Zammit Cutajar, who has written six pages of the document, studied a text of negotiations of 180 pages to focus on what the Secretary-General has described Executive on the UN climate change, Yvo de Boer, as &quot;the full picture&quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It shows the guidelines for a possible agreement in which the industrial nations collectively reduce their emissions in 2020, 25 to 45 percent compared to 1990 levels, while the main developing countries, during the same period, reduce their 15 to 30 percent. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Together, the countries would reduce emissions between 50 and 95 percent for 2050. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The European Union has also re-launched negotiations, Friday, promising to provide $3.6 billion annually for the next three years to help the poorest countries to adapt to the impact of climate change -- to withstand floods and drought or for avoided deforestation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> However, on Friday, the same verbal altercations occurred, which dominated the negotiations since last week. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Todd Stern, the US representative to the negotiating climate rejected any discussion requiring the reduction of greenhouse gases by industrialised countries, in comparison with the voluntary efforts made by the major emerging economies, if they were not funded by the developed countries. </seg>
<seg id="14"> This change is a signal that the Obama administration becomes harder towards China that the Bush administration has been, it two years ago. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="3"> The first high-speed commuter train of countries reach 225 km / h, while it Filera Ashford, in Kent, to London St Pancras, covering 93 km in 38 minutes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Lord Adonis, the Transport Minister, will be joined by Dame Kelly Holmes in the first commuter train javelin outside London. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> He hoped that the new service will allow Britain to integrate an international network of fast trains and reliable and link the large conurbations of the Midlands, the North and Scotland to London. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The small holes lost become commuter cities successful business travel times will be much less long and the passage of the plane and car to train reduce national emissions of carbon while reducing congestion on the roads. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In theory, the three main political parties adhering to this project. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the ten billion pounds needed to build a new rail network, the battle of planning inevitable and fears of risks to the environment will hamper British high-speed lines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> According to the Times, High Speed Two (HS2), a company established in January to conduct a feasibility report for the Government, will her paper to Lord Adonis on 30 December. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It will enable her to obtain a detailed map of the itinerary of the next stage for the high speed network. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The new line linking London to the West Midlands will be drawn in the five metres of the urban area and sites where the impact on the environment can be controversial. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the campaign, the plan will be drawn up to 25 metres of the final itinerary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> It is also expected that HS2 presents three options for a high speed network, to the north. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Lord Adonis will spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The preferred options are put forward in a &quot;Y&quot; configuration for which a high-speed line will go to the West Midlands. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The line is split into two at or near Birmingham, with a branch to the West Pennines Àmanchester and Scotland and another to the northeast, Sheffield, Leeds and Newcastle upon Tyne. </seg>
<seg id="17"> A single line through Scotland. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> &quot;It seems that this will be the best option of performance said a professional of rail. </seg>
<seg id="19"> When completed, the travel time between London and Edinburgh will be reduced to 2 hours 40 minutes. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first part, which will not open until 2025, will allow all passengers to travel between London and Birmingham in 49 minutes, compared to a travel an hour currently. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The proposals will train to travel to 400km / h, making the UK network the fastest in the world. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The original route is designed to allow trains to 400m in length and carrying 1100 people. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Up to 18 trains per hour can operate on a line London - Birmingham. </seg>
<seg id="24"> A terminal accommodating 20,000 passengers per hour would be necessary. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Given the constraints of space, it is anticipated that an existing station will be expanded to receive the high speed network. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The rail industry experts say that only St Pancras International or Euston offer this opportunity. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Lord Adonis will announce whether or not he feels that the project must be put in place, but public consultations longer and planning procedures mean that a final decision will not be taken before a general election. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Even if it launches the machine, the network will be constructed in part by part. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The first trains will be forced to drive out of the high speed lines on the existing track north of Birmingham, maintaining journey times between London and Scotland than three hours. </seg>
<seg id="30"> This solution seems to be the best aircraft to ensure passage of trains, constituting a reference point for the revolution of rail. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The court of Nanterre decided Friday to judge the artist François-marie Banier to determine if, as the accused the daughter of billionaire Liliane Bettencourt, it has benefited from a state of weakness in the octogenarian for Rob part of his fortune. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The photographer 62 years, known for his photographs of stars, will be judged on the 15 and 16 April 2010 for abuse of weakness, an offence punishable by a maximum penalty of three years imprisonment and fine of €375,000. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> This decision means that there will be a trial in this case worthy of a saga on one of the richest families of France, in which mother and daughter will snap while taking the reins of the empire of cosmetics L&apos;Oréal. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But 15 Criminal Chamber also ordered that a medical expertise of Liliane Bettencourt, 87 years old, should be conducted cooperatively by three doctors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The heiress, and major shareholder of L&apos;Oréal has always refused to submit to such an examination, at least not in the conditions proposed by the Procuracy of Nanterre during the investigation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The designated physicians Friday will submit a report before March 10, 2010 saying if Liliane Bettencourt in particular has been in a state of weakness and what time periods. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="8"> I believe that it will. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I will speak to him, said the release of the hearing counsel for Mrs Bettencourt, Mr. Kiejman. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> For its part, Françoise Bettencourt-meyers&apos;s lawyer, Olivier Metzner, has welcomed the decision of the Court. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is an excellent new (...) the expertise show that he (Mr Banier) handled this elderly lady that we must protect, he said. </seg>

<seg id="12"> For two years, the only daughter of Liliane Bettencourt has committed for criminal prosecutions against François-marie Banier, photographer and artist hands-on, for have benefited for years from the weakness of his mother to obtain EUR one billion in grants, in the form of cheques, life assurance contracts or tables of masters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> For its part, Liliane Bettencourt has always denied having been handled by the photographer, it considers as a long-standing friend. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> While the Tribunal should examine the admissibility of the action brought by Ms Bettencourt-meyers, the pleadings of lawyers have sometimes turned to unpacking family Friday. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Thus, Counsel Liliane Bettencourt has three letters sent by his client (in 1999, 2003 and 2005) to his notary, in which she said was wary of Françoise Bettencourt-meyers&apos;s husband. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In the letter dated 2003, Liliane Bettencourt added, according to counsel: &quot;Could you please explain to my daughter that I wrote to Banier once, twice a day for 15 years. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Françoise, I have never spoken to him since her marriage &quot;. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> For its part, the prosecutor in Nanterre, new estimated that the complainant was not entitled to act, to much more than a guardianship judge has refused these last few days to grant his request to open a procedure of judicial protection for his mother. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Liliane Bettencourt &quot;has full capacity to act, it is not under protection and no guardian. </seg>
<seg id="20"> No one else has to act in his place &quot;, the department&apos;s representative asserted, Marie-chrsitine Daubigney. </seg>

<seg id="3"> For more than a decade, the attitude of big business management in relation to its employees, recalls the position of vis-à-vis consumers before the revolution marketing: it is to join the staff to &quot;values&quot; defined above as it was once, to dictate to consumers of products devised by the technicians of the plant. </seg>
<seg id="4"> By putting the customer at the heart of the company, revolution marketing has presented the strategies of conquest of markets to the spot... although the authoritarian temptation to impose products disconnected preferences factors populations return regularly! </seg>

<seg id="6"> The France Telecom suicides, PSA and Renault are only the tip of a much more general phenomenon which affects the frameworks in particular. </seg>

<seg id="11"> Even the most ambitious planners have recognized that the cost to bury the station in the respective capitals Hesse and Bavaria, was exorbitant. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, the head of the line stations no longer pose real problems of entry and exit since there are trains modern, reversible with railcars and Voiture-pilote at both ends. </seg>

<seg id="5"> Peter Frey who heads the drafting of ZDF was the favourite in Berlin. </seg>
<seg id="6"> However, the chain has not wished to confirm - officially – in order not to pre-empt the vote on the procedure. </seg>
<seg id="7"> However, it appears that there was also the willingness to do no harm to the intendant of ZDF Markus Schächter on cases where the proposal would not be accepted by the Board of Directors. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Frey, who is the candidate of Schächter, need the vote of 9 members of the Committee on 14. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The result of the vote was not yet known at the conclusion of the drafting of this edition. </seg>

<seg id="10"> It two weeks ago, Schächter had proposed the Board to extend the contract by five years of Nikolaus Brender, but it had been rejected. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Only seven members of the Council had reported favourable to the extension of Brender and 7 others had voted against. the dismissal by Brender represented a great failure although predictable for Schächter. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In fact, the CDU, which is majority on the Board had already suggested several weeks before the vote, not want to renew Brender. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is Roland Koch, the minister-president of the Land of Hesse who had organized a League against the editor. </seg>
<seg id="14"> He had refused to extend the contract of esteemed editor on the grounds that the ratings of emissions information of ZDF had fallen below Brender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> That is why protests were still taking place, almost until the vote, denounced the growing political influence on ZDF. </seg>
<seg id="16"> At the end there was even 35 experts in public law who had meddled in the debate and which felt that the way Koch was unconstitutional. </seg>

<seg id="19"> Peter Frey was born on 4 August 1957 to Bingen. </seg>
<seg id="20"> He studied the science-policy, pedagogy and Romance languages (Spanish). </seg>
<seg id="21"> He then worked in Südwestfunk (Rhineland-Palatinate) radio body and Frankfurter Rundschau (daily German national in scope). </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="23"> Then his route continues: from 1988 to 1990, he was the assistant editor of the time, then corresponding to Washington in 1991 / 1992, and in 1998 he was Chief and presenter of &quot;Morgenmagazins&quot; (bi-weekly issuance of information presented the morning); until 2001 he was responsible of the foreign policy of the ZDF then Chief of Berlin. </seg>

<seg id="26"> However, Beck does not intend to request the removal of political figures who are members of committees responsible for monitoring the ZDF. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Peter Frey, the likely successor Brender had skilfully manoeuvred to the Governing Council in strongly criticising the Commission in its decision to dismiss Brender. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> It is by these words &quot;arrival in Germany and it is beautiful, almost more control...&quot; that begins a poet Werner Söllner work, in which he describes in disturbing glimpses phrases, the experiences of a dissident arrived in Germany has won the freedom but has lost its language area at the same time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Werner Söllner, born in 1951 to Banat in Romania, was first professor of German and English to Bucharest and, subsequently, Director of collection in a publishing house for the youth before moving in Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Söllner has received various literary prizes; in 1993 it was highly prized chair of poetry of the Goethe University in Frankfurt and Since 2002 he is Director of literature of Hesse to the artist of Mousonturm in Frankfurt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> There has been much talk in not literary circles last Tuesday, at a conference in Munich, the theme of which was &quot;The German literature in Romania in the mirror and the distorting mirror of your files Securitate&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Visibly destabilized and embarrassed, Söllner made a statement in which he acknowledged to his colleagues writers Germano-roumains as Richard Wagner, William Totok, Franz Hodjak, and Helmuth Frauendorfer he had worked as an informant for the police policy Securitate. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Söllner received in 1989 the price of the German language together with some of the participants. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The trials of enrolment began in 1971. </seg>
<seg id="9"> I am, therefore, finds Söllner &quot;someone who has not sufficiently stood Auxessais of intimidation of the Securitate&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The poet Werner Söllner is the informant Walter (IM Walter). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Almost simultaneously with the Nobel Prize for Honoration Herta Müller and his literary copies with the mechanisms of power of dictatorship, the literary scene is shaken and in particular the community of German authors from Romania, by a case which clearly shows the pitfalls and the baseness of a political system, based on policing and espionage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Werner Söllner is, all that we can say after the current knowledge, not only guilty but also victim. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In his own Securitate file IM Walter played a role, provides specialist literature Michael Markel after the confession of Söllner and it refers to the positive influence of IM Walter, who had Interceded in his favour. </seg>
<seg id="14"> &quot;He had been able to draw from all difficult situations at the time,&quot; After Markel. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Markel has felt the need Moralde make this comment. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The form in which Söllner made his statement and in public was unexpected, however the admission of a former dissident of its collaboration with the secret services Romanian is in fact, not so surprising. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Germany is a reserve for spies of the Securitate had already written Herta Müller in July in the journal &quot;Die Zeit&quot;, after having read the 914 pages of his own file. </seg>
<seg id="18"> It can be assumed that the victims have made speculation and will sometimes guessed what real names were hiding last the names of loans Sorin, Voicu and Walter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> In Germany where the consultation of Stasi files is a reliable process, the attitudes to the legacy of the Securitate files is still very confused. </seg>
<seg id="20"> A systematic clarification has been frustrated and hindered in past years. </seg>
<seg id="21"> It was only in 1999 that a National Council corresponding to the institution Birthler was created to work with the assimilation of the Securitate Archives (Cnsas) but rather dragged the return of files since. </seg>
<seg id="22"> There is a law since 2005 which defines the management of archives. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> That the influence of former members of the Securitate in Romania is still very great, is confirmed by the interview of a former head of the Securitate Temesvar that, after the announcement of the award of the Nobel Prize to Herta Müller, has expressed very dismissive of the winner. </seg>
<seg id="24"> She had a psychosis, and ultimately we had questioned only once. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The infamy of power felt able to speak here, without any gene, under the pretext of freedom of expression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Certainly, there are inevitable issues associated with the case Söllner as so often happens in a context of guilt hidden. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Why now? which has been despoiled? the weighted response of listeners, to the admission of Söllner, hope that the result of this Chapter will be defined more by a thirst that by accusations and a sense of shame. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Some see, while awake, images and hear voices that no one else sees or hears. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is not only in the mental patients, or under the effect of the drug, the boundaries between imagination and reality are converging. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> As these phenomena occur during sleep, it works very well. </seg>
<seg id="5"> When we are elongated in our rooms clouded, we can explore dreams and fantasies without barriers and more. </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="7"> Of such images and voices do not appear in the mental patients or under the effect of the drug. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> It is our imagination that is in question: it is the same neuronal activity that allows us to design houses, paint pictures or write novels, but sometimes prompts the boundaries between the dream, madness and reality to melt. </seg>
<seg id="9"> A state of arousal aware, taking the form of a dream, can be in various forms, in the best case it is called of the visions, at worst of madness. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> But even if the trigger and the effect be distinguished, visions of the mystical Hildegard von Bingen, drug experiences of the Prophet of new age Carlos Castaneda, the latter States of shamans, psychoses, and hallucinations are attributable to very similar process. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> There are hallucinations or delusions when the balance, substances neurotransmitter brain - first and foremost the dopamine, norepinephrine, serotonin and Achétylcholine - breaks and that the interaction between the different parts of the brain is disrupted. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Complex of hallucinations and delusional thoughts occur very often during a schizophrenia psychosis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The force of attraction land has more power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Since antiquity, philosophers and doctors have always looked on the relationship between madness and the dream. </seg>
<seg id="15"> For Aristotle, hallucinations, were a form of Rêve-éveillé; Wilhelm Griesinger, one of the founders of the modern psychiatry, found in 1861 &quot;a great similarity between the madness and the dream,&quot; Sigmund Freud the dream was &quot;a psychosis with all irregularities, imagination, delusions and illusions sensory who composed&quot;. </seg>

<seg id="16"> We are in autumn 2001 when Henning T turn into character in a comic strip. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> Today Henning T. 40 years, he lived six acute psychosis, the last date of 2 years, the first in nearly 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="30"> It was triggered by the LSD. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The diagnosis: psychosis Schizo-affective, paranoid, in addition it is manic, he takes medication against depression, mania, schizophrenia. </seg>
<seg id="32"> He has learned to live with his illness, he is married for three years. </seg>
<seg id="33"> During the psychosis I experienced terrible fears and deep despair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The illusions are a cruel reality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> About one percent of the population suffers at least once in her life of schizophrenia; in psychiatric clinics it is the most common illness after the Depression. </seg>
<seg id="36"> In a crisis of schizophrenia, those concerned can no longer make the difference between the internal world and the outside world, they are in a state of hyper excitation, that they may suffer from hallucinations, megalomania, of folly relational or persecution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> It is very common to hear voices – voice which, which views or dialogue. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The hallucinations are not rare. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The person concerned can no longer distinguish between the large and the small, the brain can no longer filter disturbing signals, the aware is drowned in the sensations. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Just as the dream, psychosis opens the locks to a tide of ideas and fantasies outcome of deeper layers of conscience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The perception of reality in the psychosis is focused on the issue, according to Professor Thomas Fuchs, head of the Department of Psychiatry Chu in Heidelberg (Allgemeine Psychiatry IM Universitätsklinikum). </seg>
<seg id="42"> The schizophrenic is right in the centre of the situation, to a meaning focused on him. </seg>
<seg id="43"> At the same time it is found in a passive role, it is like a dream, overcome by events and actively cannot act on them. </seg>
<seg id="44"> That is why the schizophrenia often feel threatened, controlled, manipulated. </seg>
<seg id="45"> In general they do not have the possibility to adjust the reality, illusions are a cruel reality, wake is excluded. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> To experience once in her life of a hallucination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Has the difference of the dream, Fuchs said &quot;the sensory and spatial structure of reality that is collected during the psychosis, is basically retained&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="48"> The thoughts and hallucinations, delusions are based on reality, the disposal of lived in a real framework. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Why does our brain this kind of antics, is still a mystery to researchers. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Of exceptional situations can bring everyone to lose the perception of reality, according Fuchs. </seg>
<seg id="51"> But only a small number of people develop psychosis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="52"> There appears to be a genetic predisposition to schizophrenia, but studies on twins have shown that genes are not the only determinants. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The researchers speculate that the persons concerned are small brain damage. </seg>
<seg id="54"> It is assumed that neuronal maturation of the brain is disrupted at an early stage of development, for example by a viral infection of the mother during pregnancy, explains Fuchs. </seg>
<seg id="55"> But what still unexplained, this is how the neural system occurs and also the fact that it is not for many years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> The environmental factors also play a role – stress or traumatic experience can be a trigger of psychosis, if there is predisposition. </seg>
<seg id="57"> Of even the hallucinogenic drugs can trigger psychosis because they act on neurotransmitters. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> When our brain heats. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> The crazy, said Professor of Psychology Erich Kasten of Lübeck, is that the psychotic suffering from their hallucinations and take expensive drugs for dispose while others buy drugs very expensive to obtain them. </seg>
<seg id="60"> The perception pleasant or unpleasant illusions is often just a matter of perspective. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> Kasten together for ten years reports of hallucinations and illusory images: the past year it has published its findings in a book entitled &quot;the unreal world in our heads&quot;. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The hallucinations are part of the concomitant phenomena typical psychoses but also an impressive number of many other diseases. </seg>
<seg id="63"> Among them are mental disorders such as borderline or depression but also the migraines, epilepsy, multiple sclerosis, Alzheimer ’ s disease or head injury. </seg>
<seg id="64"> It is surprising to note that in some conditions even the brain of healthy people is subject to hallucinations. </seg>
<seg id="65"> The hallucinations, according to Kasten, composed of fragments of memories that are normally inhibited. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66"> They take form when areas of the brain that process the sensory perceptions, are Hyperactives or not sufficiently Refrénées; when our brain heats but also when there is a lack of stimulation. </seg>
<seg id="67"> The drugs can trigger this state as a brain injury or psychosis. </seg>
<seg id="68"> But also the lack of stimulus, stress, the pessimists of love or other mental states exceptional. </seg>
<seg id="69"> In recent studies, a third of participants acknowledged having done at least once in his life ’ s experience a hallucination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="70"> In summer 2005 Sarah K. 16 years, she lives in a small town in Mecklenburg-West Pomerania and goes to school. </seg>
<seg id="71"> A normal girl to do everything to say. </seg>
<seg id="72"> If there was not the images and voice. </seg>
<seg id="73"> During the recess, there is a young boy, thin, with long hair chestnut, address him the floor. </seg>
<seg id="74"> When she replied his comrades, look surprised – no one else see or hear this boy. </seg>
<seg id="75"> They believe that this girl is a lunatic Boggled but Sarah K no dream, it is certain. </seg>
<seg id="76"> She is awake, hears and sees this boy like she sees and hears the daughter who is sitting next to it on the bench. </seg>
<seg id="77"> It can even perceive its presence momentarily. </seg>
<seg id="78"> It is a good feeling, she finds this young sympathetic. </seg>
<seg id="79"> Am I mad?, asks sometimes. </seg>
<seg id="80"> But she knows that this young and other visions are not real and they will disappear again. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> The night appearances are, in general, frightening. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="82"> The visions are often cumbersome. </seg>
<seg id="83"> When it is in class, it is that it can follow the course because the teacher is just present a new student in his eyes and ears while it is invisible to others and that the professor is in train to explain equations table. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="84"> The night appearances are, in general, frightening. </seg>
<seg id="85"> When, in the dark of his house, it expects the sleep that is too little and too late, it often cannot make the distinction if she is awake or dream, if the images sees, the faces Grimaçants or the girl with bloody cuts on the arms and legs are to his eyes open or closed. </seg>
<seg id="86"> Let quiet, Cree to these creatures. </seg>
<seg id="87"> It does not mention or to his parents or his friends, they would take to a mad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="88"> Fall 2009. Sarah K. today 20 years. </seg>
<seg id="89"> She was LAC last year and she lives with her friend. </seg>
<seg id="90"> One year ago the hallucinations have ceased. </seg>
<seg id="91"> Since it came into contact with the psychologist Kasten through the Internet she knows very well that it is not mad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="92"> The madness is also a work of art of despair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="93"> When a person is socially isolated or has not enough of stimuli, the probability is high that he has hallucinations after a certain time. </seg>
<seg id="94"> I assume that the brain is not busy enough, so that there is the animation. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="95"> Sarah K., only daughter, was afraid of other children when it was small and often play only. </seg>
<seg id="96"> Its hallucinations began when she learned to 13 years, the man she called Dad, since it was in age thinking, was not his real father. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="97"> This is the same brain areas that are active for visual hallucinations and acoustic, and for actual impressions and noise, so it is very difficult for people like Sarah K to the difference between the illusion and reality. &quot;experience&quot;, according to Kasten &apos;place in the brain, the reality is formed from. </seg>
<seg id="98"> The hallucinations are also images that form in the brain, that is why they seem so real. &quot; </seg>
<seg id="99"> For Kasten, dreams night are also a form of hallucination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="100"> The hallucinations of healthy individuals do not differ fundamentally from those acute psychosis. </seg>
<seg id="101"> In contrast to schizophrenia, mentally healthy people is able to recognise that the fantasies are not real images. </seg>
<seg id="102"> That is why Kasten advises his patients to cherish the hallucinations as a particular talent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="103"> There was a step between the dream and the hallucination. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="104"> In our world too focused on awareness unfortunately has quickly tend to take experiences imaginary for diseases, according to Michael Schmidt-degenhard, Heidelberg and chief medical officer of the Clinical Professor of Psychiatry and Psychotherapy at the Florence Nightingale Hospital in Düsseldorf. </seg>
<seg id="105"> A psychosis is a serious disease, painful but which also contains something positive, creator - the madness is a work of art of despair. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="106"> Schmidt-degenhard studied form of Oniroïde experience, a particular form of the conscience stirred by the dream. </seg>
<seg id="107"> The experienced Oniroïdes are very complex Semi-rêves that are perceived as genuine by the lives and cannot differentiate the dream even when it is in a state of arousal. </seg>
<seg id="108"> The state of consciousness Oniroïde for a trauma or in situations of extreme conditions as for patients with Polyradiculopathie that fully aware, experience of motor paralysis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="109"> According to Schmidt-degenhard, when a human being is threatened by a loss of self and the world, due to a total and sustainable to move, it replaces the real situation which affects his life by his own imaginary world is dissociated from reality. </seg>
<seg id="110"> It is a state of mental limit between the dream and the hallucination. </seg>
<seg id="111"> As it is not possible to overcome the situation in reality, a change of world place but the real situation is represented in the imagination. </seg>
<seg id="112"> It is, in fact, a form of means and interpretation, in a situation is in itself unacceptable, a capacity for organisation which we is given, to the men, to not fall in the nil loss of consciousness. </seg>
<seg id="113"> Everything is real even later in the memories. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="114"> The Zurich Peter Cornelius Classen, an art historian also describes his experiences Oniroïdes in his book &quot;change of heart&quot; as safeguard action of the soul. </seg>
<seg id="115"> He was 49 years, when its aware share for a trip of several days after a heart valve operation followed a transplant; meanwhile, his body is condemned to remain motionless in resuscitation. </seg>
<seg id="116"> Claussen into a world that he has created all parts, site visit foreign, journey through time. It is old man bed in a sanatorium rail, a robot to his bedside ensuring on her health. </seg>
<seg id="117"> He lives in the Middle Ages of noble which manufacture drugs based on blood. </seg>
<seg id="118"> It is abducted by a Greek motorcycle which take in his country, he surfing with his hospital bed in the Firn Alps and encounter a Mafia Korean. </seg>
<seg id="119"> It is absorbed completely in this imaginary world, everything is real even later in its memories. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="120"> To Claussen these domestic travel is fundamentally different from any dream. </seg>
<seg id="121"> The dream is a completely different state, wrote in describing what he experienced. </seg>
<seg id="122"> On the contrary dreams, memories from travel mental are extremely clear and very detailed even years later. </seg>
<seg id="123"> We can even say that they are much more distinct and more intensive than the real experience. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="124"> The intensity of this experience Atomises the horizons of our other daily experiences, according to the psychiatrist Schmidt-degenhard. </seg>
<seg id="125"> In short, the Oniroïdes, psychoses, delusions, hallucinations and experiences we show how our representations home of external reality are fragile even in Eve. </seg>
</p>

<seg id="3"> He took of his five minutes of fame in the United States, when Time magazine the designated as one of the products of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In truth, it is more difficult to see in the street, but the idea seems interesting, especially for youth. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Unlike smartphones, peek offers a monthly subscription prices and a very low, less than half of what it costs, for example, the subscription data of the iPhone. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Given its success, the company launched two new devices: one designed exclusively for Twitter, the other with a free service of life, data for six times more expensive than peek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Fonpeek, presented yesterday at the event the web is the European version of the invention and its third incarnation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It is also limited its Grand-frère American, but includes a surprise. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The price of its monthly subscription, approximately €12, includes the roaming throughout Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Those who travel with smartphones already know what to give to data when it crosses a border or seek desperately a cafeteria on the (or a connection FON WiFi) to consult his mail. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The idea of a roaming at a fixed price is incredibly attractive and it is time that it should operate. </seg>

<seg id="12"> In fact, some operators have special arrangements and options journey, but as far as I am concerned, I would need to have a thesis in physics to understand and good glasses to read the small print. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The repeated reminders to the agenda of the European Commission to propose roaming fees affordable throughout Europe have a barely perceptible effect. </seg>
<seg id="14"> To the outside his country of origin, we hesitate to use the data, and is not wrong. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> That a small device as the Fonpeek (it is always curious that it is called Fon when it does not have the WiFi) offers this type of tariffs, means that the operators are beginning to think differently and studying various proposals to make their data network. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Discrimination in the workplace has increased in recent years, especially for younger generations who women want to be mothers. </seg>
<seg id="3"> This is what study reveals &quot;fertility and career women in Spain,&quot; conducted by the CSIC in collaboration with the Instituto de la Mujer. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The investigation, conducted on 9 737 women 15 to 75 years, leaves no room for doubt: 75% of working mothers have seen their career limited due to motherhood. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The study indicates that there are many differences about the beginning of life as a couple and the number of children, if the woman works or not and the type of job. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Those who have no activity outside the home, working part-time or have a stable work little, more earlier in couple, have their first pregnancy and have more children. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Women between the ages of 35 and 49 with a fixed work have their first child, in average, 3.7 years after being installed in couple. This figure rises to 4.1 among those who work in the public sector. &quot;The data show that women having stable employment have more time in their lives to obtain, which took them to extend the Union and the arrival of children. </seg>
<seg id="9"> In addition, the type of employment influence largely maternity, but less the date the beginning of living together, &quot;says researcher of CSIC Margarita Delgado. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The level of education is another factor that widening the gap in the age of marriage of women and their first child. </seg>
<seg id="11"> According to the survey, the higher the level of training, the more they marry and have their first child later. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The difference is also maintains among women of the same generation. </seg>
<seg id="13"> For example, in the group between 35 and 49 years, those who have made elementary and higher education were mothers respectively for the first time at 25.1 and 32.1 years on average. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> &quot;Another Distinctness is also between women, depending on their level of education. </seg>

<seg id="4"> However, we need to qualify the good news since the reference for the comparison, the month of November 2008, was particularly bad, with a 60% decrease compared to the previous year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> As a result, despite the rebound last month, registrations gathered during these 11 months are 40% below those of the previous year. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Since January, if we add all the vehicles which fall in the category of light commercial vehicles (derivatives of passenger cars, pickup trucks, vans, and light trucks to chassis light) 95 853 were sold. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The dark clouds that affect their application are not dispelled. In effect, although they are also purchased by individuals, most purchases are made by small or medium-sized enterprises, which pay in almost 100% of cases through an external funding. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Up to 1 100 accidents </seg>

<seg id="11"> At the top of the list are Manchester United and Bayern Munich, two teams who, in addition, have billed the more money for their participation in the last Champions League. </seg>
<seg id="12"> And that, although they have lost before the Barça. </seg>
<seg id="13"> On the other hand, Spain is only the third country, as regards the money reported in the Champions League, although it has won more titles than any other (five, while Italy has won four, England three and Germany two). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Distribution </seg>
</p>

<seg id="17"> Of this amount, the UEFA will 285,413.1 million in fixed payments: each of the 20 clubs who have participated in classification matches (including the Atlético de Madrid) received 2.1 million. </seg>
<seg id="18"> In addition, those who were able to participate received 3.8 million just to be there, more than 550 00 EUR for each match. </seg>
<seg id="19"> There is also a bonus in the event of victory (EUR 800 000) and equality (400 000 for each team). Those who arrive in Eighths of final three million each, the eight teams who arrive in a Quarter-final Reçoivent3,3 million. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The last four teams will each 4 million. </seg>
<seg id="21"> And the champion will win 9 million, the 5.2 received by the other finalist. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Thus, under fixed payments, a club win at least 7.1 million, and the maximum 31.2 million. </seg>
<seg id="23"> On the other hand, the Barça pocketed 2.5 million for having won the European Super Cup in August. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> But in addition, there are varying payments, which are spent 337.8 million. </seg>
<seg id="25"> This money is distributed according to the proportional value of each television market. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The Spanish market is one of the most important, and has four dedicated places. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The champion of the previous year pocketing 40% of the money allocated, 30% for the second, 20% for the third and 10% for the fourth. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The other party will be paid according to the number of matches played in the edition of the current year. </seg>
