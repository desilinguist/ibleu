<seg id="1"> What is what it will occur? CSSD knows neither Voldemort nor of pastry making in Prague. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The newly-elected representatives of CSSD to the town hall of the capital will have apparently to surmount a real linguistic barrier to understand themselves on the level of the town council with their old and new colleagues of the ODS. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Actualne.cz daily newspaper "tested" the new members of the town council pertaining to CSSD, namely if they know the slang which was born during last years with the town hall, when they were the partners of the current coalition who directed to Prague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The coded vocabulary that the political cream of Prague started during the previous era of the mayor Pavel Bem describes some of the personalities, situations, and causes of the metropolis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> It is with surprise which it was discovered that the newly-elected representatives do not understand the known terms very well. </seg>
<seg id="6"> At least they say it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> "Which is Valdemort." </seg>
<seg id="8"> "I really do not know." </seg>
<seg id="9"> "I am a young fellow in the policy pragoise reacted Lukas Kaucky, the elected official with the culture with the test of the vocabulary of the "godfather." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> And concerning the political veteran, the elected official Karel Brezina reacted in the same way. </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example the direction of "hole of golf." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "It is the only expression among those which you propose to me that I use" </seg>
<seg id="13"> If not, I do not use the slang. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> Vocabulary, of which the Aktualne.cz daily newspaper published the expressions in June this year before the pre-éĺectoral congress of the ODS, the drafting chose 6 examples, in priority those which are dependant with the town hall of Prague. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The Socialists were to explain the direction of "Voldemort," "the largest hole of golf in Prague," to go to pastry making," "beef animal nerve," "treason of the capital" and "to fleece." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Three of the elected officials were of agreement for the quiz, fourth Antonin Weinert, who must direct education to Prague in the future - promised a maintenance first of all but then the telephone did not take down. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The fifth elected official Petr Dolinek straightforwardly refused the test. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "I do not deal at all with these things there and how the representatives of the democracy citizen have fun: I will not give my opinion." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "I currently deal with the way in which we will understand ourselves within the framework of our programs," T he has reacted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> As one already heard, the elected official Lukas Kaucky apparently does not recognize in the legend above, that it is influential Janousek on the entrepreneurs and friends of the ex-mayor Roman Bem. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "Voldemort" does not say anything á' Kaucky and the only expression which he guessed in the test is "the largest hole of golf in Prague." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> "It is the Blanka tunnel" says Kaucky and adds immediately: "But I know it newspapers." </seg>
<seg id="23"> "I will have to pay me a language class," T joke he. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Not only the matador Karel Brezina but as Lukas Plachy, the elected official for the environment, know as the hole of golf is the tunnel of Blanko. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> The two social democrats know who is really Voldemort and Lukas Plachy knows the place where to find the character - he thinks within the meaning of "going to pastry making." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> "It acts, I think, to go in a company," Plachy is ready to guess that it is the seat of the companies of Janousek. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> On the same tone Brezina recalls that it rather draws its knowledge from the newspapers and not from any vocabulary which it would use. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> According to the candidates with the tests there does not exist any lexicon of slang in the social democracy. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> "I took council with colleagues and it appears that we really do not have something of this type." </seg>
<seg id="30"> "One rather says the names some time one uses abbreviations and symbols," known as Peter Hlinsky, President of the Party socio-democrat, that the members of the Party call Hulda. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> "Me was called Briza at the school but I do not know if my colleagues call me like that, Karel Brezina in connection with the nicknames acknowledges. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Actuel.cz daily newspaper tested the name and it goes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> The Weinert elected official is Papy for the members of the Party or the least friendly Little old man, the representative Miroslav Poche, who drew attention to him before the elections by the swindles during the sponsoring of the party, is called "the small toy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The nicknames are also the only ones which inside the party the social democrats admit to employ. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> It appears that Hulinsky does not like much to hear Hulda, but the Akutel.cz daily newspaper recorded another nickname for this president pragois. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> "Doctor of Laws of bludgeon" recalls appears it that Petr Hulinsky obtained its title of JUDr. Doctor of Laws to the police academy of Bratislava. </seg>

<seg id="7"> At the same time as of the work contracts at decreased time, the nursery school is a no-claims bonus suggested to its employees by company arch. Design. within the framework of its social program. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The house in bone fascine still after 100 years. Throw an eye in the interiors of Gaudi. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The roof resembles on the back of a prehistoric saurian, the staircase with a spinal column of dinosaur and the balconies with open fish mouths. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Thus is the house Casa Battlo in Barcelona of the architect Antoni Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Because of its organic forms, the house received on behalf of the buildings the nickname of House in bone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Organic forms, colors wild, use unusual of stones, fragments of squares and mosaîque, frontage pointing out of the scales and everywhere present curves, here all that is ypic for the Art nouveau of Antoni Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The frontal frontage of the house unrolls its lines of dream, its pleasant colors and textures which point out nature and the animals. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> During a more detailed observation one sees the geometry, the rhythm and the order thought with precision. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the night the frontage of the house becomes even more dramatic and is lit in such way that the impression of brightness of the colors is reinforced with it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> The rolling up and the torsion of the forms also appear in the interiors with same measurement. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Wood copies in waves the windowframes, the balustrades, the decorative elements of the doors, the eyepiece and the strips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The Battlo house which is drawn up in the Eixample district in the commercial street Passeig of Gracia to the number. 43, was born from the construction of a house of 1877 of the architect Emilio Sala the Cortes. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The rebuilding was done during two years and the house finished in 1906. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The investor, Joseph Battlo, a rich entrepreneur, insisted initially on the demolition of the old construction and the construction of another any news but quickly accepted the idea of Gaudi of the unusual rebuilding and cheaper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> But the idea of Put Battlo as an apartment building was not thought by Gaudi alone. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The architect Josep Maria Jujol worked with him. </seg>
<seg id="16"> It is precisely on its project that were born decorations for an apartment from representation of the owner of the building and the use of mosaîque for the frontage. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> For the frontage also worked of other artists and creators. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Common work for the plans of the house Casa Battlo begin with a co-operation with success between Jujol and Gaudi. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Jujol took part in the construction of the house of Gaudi Casa Mila and the Guell park in which there are other works of Gaudi. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The buildings called the hot house just after its completion because of its organic forms "the House in bone." </seg>
<seg id="21"> Others, in view of specific mechanism of opening of the windows called it "the house which bucket." </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is said that at the top of construction there is a sword similar to that of Saint Georges the owner of Catalonia. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Other elements of sculpture of construction contain hidden religious reasons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Gaudi thought for the house a single system in its central warming-up time, with vents of ventilation and typical chimneys. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Their slope of 45 degrees seems odd. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> During Gaudi creation absolutely did not respect the directives of construction of then and did not let itself block by them. </seg>
<seg id="27"> At the beginning of construction it obtained on behalf of the city the building permit, knowing, of course that the data related to the plans of rebuilding were so vague that two years afterwards during the completion the town council was horrified and asked for modifications. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> It did not like, for example, with the members of the town council which the pillars of construction empiettent on the public pavement. </seg>
<seg id="29"> There was never modification, but, on the contrary, only 15 days after the call of the city Josep Battlo asked for (and satisfaction obtained) the authorization of rent the two higher stages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The owner moved on the lower floors. </seg>
<seg id="31"> In the gallery on the second floor there was a living room common and to the third a room and a private part of the apartment. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The ground floor was rented with a jewelry. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The whole house of six floors is divided by a staircase by which one reaches to an independent terrace of roof. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> All the right angles and the straight lines were cancelled by the basic elements of the rebuilding and their replacement by curved walls. </seg>
<seg id="35"> Gaudi also worked the modern concept of connection of spaces. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The common part can be connected completely by opening the doors of the living rooms and the high society can communicate comfortably or to limit the space deprived for more intimate talks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> The house with the rebuilding of Gaudi received in addition to new frontages a nontraditional roof and two stages moreover. </seg>
<seg id="38"> The play of Gaudi with the light is also impressive, of the blue and white glazed tiles with which is decorated the interior court and with the wells of lights. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The play with two colors gives a maximum of light in all the floors of the house. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It was simply enough to bet on the principle that the white reflête more than sinks it which on the contrary absorbs the rays of the sun. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> The house Put Battlo which was registered in 2005 in the Funds of the World heritage of UNESCO perhaps visited by each one. </seg>
<seg id="42"> On the first floor of the house is the most roomy apartment and most splendid accessible to the public. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The owners decided to take this step in 2002 at the time of the 150ème birthday of the birth of the famous creator. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> They continued the visits because they noted that it is about a lucrative company and they widened the field of the visits to common spaces and the attic including the terraces of roof. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The ticket of entry in the monument is really not expensive and costs 16.50 euros\; the students, the pensioners, the groups and the holders of touristic maps have 20 percent of reduction. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="46"> The sum is nevertheless above entrance fee in other constructions of Gaudi in the city. </seg>
<seg id="47"> If you want to feel the real atmosphere of the house with its fantastic turrets, you must quickly find a comrade among the inhabitants of the building and visit the house completely. </seg>

<seg id="1"> How to choose a mattress and a diagrid: the women have other criteria that the men. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> No the ostentatious framework, but rather surface quality reserved for sleeping, therefore the mattress and the diagrid give a real base for a good bed. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Must of course be complementary harmoniously to like them a concrete user. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> During the choice several things are determining: the weight, size, the age, the health status as well as the sex of the owner. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The type of interior in which one will place the mattress and the diagrid is also important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A typical example? </seg>
<seg id="7"> For example in the country house where one does not sleep continuously the latex mattresses are not suitable because they "are heated" gently. </seg>
<seg id="8"> They have, in addition, a weight higher than the standard polyurethane mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> It is necessary to frequently turn over them. </seg>
<seg id="10"> If they also do not have enough ventilating ducts in the middle and if they remain, moreover, on a solid board, they retain moisture. Mould can be also formed there. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The practice is also determining in the choice. </seg>
<seg id="12"> That which passes the light of time abroad when one frequently uses very thick mattresses with a softening layer, will feel of course with difficulty a low and hard surface. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> "Thus all the hokeyists who return from NHL feel sorry for that they cannot sleep over there." </seg>
<seg id="14"> "For their tired shoulders, the feet and the coasts, they needed mattress with a softening layer of lazy foam." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "Such mattresses are also recommended for the people who suffer from diabetes which has a disorder of the nervous system which thus badly assumes "information" of the articulations and the skin," explains Sylva Adamczikova which specializes in the stuffed pieces of furniture. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Therefore there is a few years the mattress with lazy foam conquered the hokeyists as well as other customers. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "Today everything works well, Tempur, Italian Magnifex but also Czech Tropico have for example suitable mattresses. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> You do not need to be a guy of NHL to be able to appreciate a lazy foam. </seg>
<seg id="19"> This "miracle" functions simply. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It optimizes its rigidity and its form according to absorptive heat or adapts to the heat of your body. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Nothing puts pressure on you and you will not be turned over in the night as after a difficult match. </seg>
<seg id="22"> You sleep simply better. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Lazy foam also functions like a protection against the esquarres. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> For the choice of the mattress according to your size, add the length of the feet, that is to say approximately 21/34 cm. </seg>
<seg id="25"> A man and a woman of a size of 180cm thus need a bed of 210/220 cm. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The minimal width for each one for a double bed should be 90 cm is in all 180 cm. </seg>
<seg id="27"> For the beds in only one place, the individual ones for example, it is recommended to take at least 120 /140 cm. </seg>
<seg id="28"> It is convenient in the event of visit. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> 'However it is a simple rule for the width of the bed: when you are lying on the back you should pose the hands in a comfortable way with the slightly folded elbows. Helena Prokopova, President of the Association of the Harness-maker-mattress makers and decorators who has devoted themselves for several years to the problems of a healthy sleep and the ergonomics of furniture and the sign in the specialized schools. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> For a double bed each one needs its own diagrid and mattress, therefore attention however during achât to choose the height of the mattress well. </seg>
<seg id="31"> If not it will only remain you to assemble the diagrid to various heights and that is not realizable on all the executives of bed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> The mattresses foam should have a minimal height of 14 cm, the spring mattresses at least 15 cm, of that count for the ventilation and subgrade at least three centimetres. </seg>
<seg id="33"> "With the touch or in sitting position on the mattress you should not feel the springs," Héléna Prokopova prevents. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> Each mattress requires a well defined type of diagrid. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The bed-diagrid, when the mattress and the diagrid are plain like Siamese twins, does not have anything to make in the bedrooms. </seg>
<seg id="36"> The mattresses are aired very badly\; one should not wash it, which is usually made auhourd' today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="37"> And since during the night one perspires normally from 0.2 to 0.75 L of sweat it is clear that after 5/7 years, the mattress starts to point out a large (and stopped) sieve. </seg>
<seg id="38"> For that the specialists refuse to make advertisement over one 25 years lifetime of for a mattress or a guarantee with life. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> But very with its but. </seg>
<seg id="40"> And for this reason a council of experiment on behalf of the salesmen: for a mattress of 120/140cm, give up, for the coating of the mattress, to hygiene or washing but add a mattress of protection rather that easily vouspouvez to withdraw and wash. </seg>
<seg id="41"> And even if nowadays it is frequent to manufacture coatings with zipper for all the unit, i.e. that after the opening one has two parts (for washing and the size of the washing machine it is very important!) if not handling for the great models (and only one person) becomes when one withdraws them a combat between a light weight and a heavyweight on a boxing ring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="42"> Do you have in your bed a rigid board instead of a diagrid? </seg>
<seg id="43"> Never! </seg>
<seg id="44"> To the maximum for a bed intended for the visitors for only one night. </seg>
<seg id="45"> However equip the board (if there is not) air vents and use the spring mattress with a minimal height of 15cm with springs out of sachets (of Germany Taschenfederken) and a layer of ventilation. </seg>
<seg id="46"> A polyurethane mattress should not be part of a bed of this type. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> For the diagrids with strips with single position with 14/18 strips, the latex mattresses or known as sandwiches (perhaps combination of latex and coconut), are the ideal but will be always better for you to have a mattress with more strips, 28 and above, where the strips are doubled in the part of the bottom of the kidneys and that it is thus possible to control rigidity of it. </seg>
<seg id="48"> For the mattresses with several positions one should not take spring mattress because it does not answer the changes of position. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> Beside the adjustment of the rigidity of the strips one can also install what one calls a cradle of shoulder. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is about a special connection of the strips which makes it possible to put pressure to even incline the strip so that the shoulder of the sleeper "is integrated" well. </seg>
<seg id="51"> For the men who have "the shoulders as broad as the back," it is really an important thing. </seg>
<seg id="52"> This thing is already considered by the manufacturers of mattresses which for the "masculines" started to use a zone softening on the level of the shoulders. </seg>
<seg id="53"> But they also think of the women - they again offer to them a softer surface on the level of the hips. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="54"> For the most difficult customer there are diagrids with wings or plates with what one calls a suspension multiforce. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The pressure is disseminated in more points and diinue the tension. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="56"> But of course, attention, as soon as you use a bad pillow (large and inflated air) on good mattresses and diagrid, "more" disappears. </seg>
<seg id="57"> The basic rule is a very simple pillow: the pillow must support the head and its points must reach only the shoulders, so that the muscles of the shoulders can rest. </seg>
<seg id="58"> The size recommended is 50X60 cm that the Scandinavians by exmple prefer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="59"> When one is lengthened on the side, the pillow must level (with the cradle of shoulder of the diagrid or the zone softened in the mattress) the height of the shoulders. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="60"> The modern mattresses still have something of commun run with the first containing straw and of grass. </seg>
<seg id="61"> The manufacturers still use natural matters or many mixtures. </seg>
<seg id="62"> The tendency is also with the organic mattress. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> The raw materials containing oil, from which the polyurethane is manufactured, are replaced by natural oils, such as for example of the soya oil. </seg>
<seg id="64"> Almost all the known manufacturers precisely use soya. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="65"> "The Bio qualifier for the mattresses means that the heart is manufactured containing natural products," Petr vasicek company Tropico Plus explains. </seg>
<seg id="66"> The natural matters are also used for the coatings of the mattresses\; one of the first was the aloe will vera. </seg>
<seg id="67"> But you can add to it microphone-capsules which develop perfumes of the forest or lavender. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="68"> There exist differences between the man and the woman. </seg>
<seg id="69"> Whereas the extract of plants of birch so that the coating of the mattress absorbs heat and cools the body, "kills" the man, the coatings "heat" the women. </seg>
<seg id="70"> The red pepper extract accelerates blood circulation and is thus hotter for the weaker sex. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> The preferred current ones? </seg>
<seg id="72"> The mattresses manufactured starting from cold foam (it have more pores with a thus disturbed cellular structure more breathing that the standard polyurethane and have more elasticity. </seg>
<seg id="73"> The combination of various rigidities of cold foams gives mattresses polyzones which know precisely where is the head, the bottom of the back and the feet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="74"> You will pay a mattress of quality starting from 7000 crowns and more. </seg>
<seg id="75"> Those which are characterized by their parameters for health have less VAT and are taken as instruments for health. </seg>
<seg id="76"> As a Czech Republic, it is Gumotex which reached the first place. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="77"> To save for the mattress and the diagrid is not simple. </seg>
<seg id="78"> One can from time to time have within the framework of special actions on behalf of the manufacturers or the producers two mattresses for the price of only one. </seg>
<seg id="79"> As for example the Magniflex company which proposes Duofreeze mattresses with foam with Memory memory bent with the coating for 11990 crowns. </seg>
<seg id="80"> One can obviously take the second free. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="81"> The era of lazy or viscoelastic foams with an open cellular structure and a great thickness was started with the Tempur matter at "cosmic" intervals. </seg>
<seg id="82"> That started as matter for NASA because the astronauts underwent with the starting of the enormous load factors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="83"> Tempur softens with heat and hardens, on the contrary, cold. </seg>
<seg id="84"> It thus adapts perfectly to the hot human body and distributes to him an optimal pressure. </seg>
<seg id="85"> It is for that ideal against the evil slept and for an increase in comfort during the sleep. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="86"> Viscoelastic foams are used not only for the mattresses but also for the products for health, as the special cushions for the feet which relieve the venous legs and system. </seg>
<seg id="87"> The Czech manufacturers use for example foam EucathermC or Twinsaver or of the same type. </seg>

<seg id="3"> Thanks to the direction of the objective of the winner Farmet has the worst moments behind oneself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> That which came to seek the price with Slovansky dum for the first place of the contest for the Firm of the year organized by Vodaphone last year is Karel Zdarsky the owner of the Farmet company. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The jury rewarded the efforts with which it transformed a workshop of tools with Ceska Skalice into a firm with the turnover of 100 million crowns. </seg>
<seg id="6"> 'I can say that the reward encouraged not to only me my also my collaborators and increased our self-confidence to fight against competition," the winner of the contest of last year declares today. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the beginning of the history of the Farmet company there was the desire to do something of useful. </seg>
<seg id="8"> And thus when the state proposed to the father of Karel Zdrasky to rent the small workshop like compensation after the confiscation of the goods by the Communists, he did not hesitate a long time, refused a career in a firm where he worked at the time, and created a company with some comrades in the entourage of his father for the manufacturing of plastic bath-tubs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Not very a long time after they started to specialize in the presses for vegetable oil. </seg>
<seg id="10"> It became after eighteen years the largest manufacturer of automatic presses in Central Europe. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The company was known even in the public not specialized after the success obtained with the contest through the media. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "Not only our customers started with really better knowing the Farmet mark but also the foreign partners who started to realize that they collaborated with a company which obtained greatest success in its country of origin," said Karel Zdarsky. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But the past year E did not occur to Farmet only ldans the euphoria from the victory. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The evaluation of the company had been made starting from the economic results of 2008 and partly of 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> And precisely in 2009 it was the most difficult year for the sale of machines of engineering. </seg>
<seg id="16"> With highest of the crisis, which did not really touch the citizens, the companies were obliged to stop their investment projects and to start to limit their achâts of new materials and technologies. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "We do not have obviously escaped with this situation." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "The turnover fell from 40 percent, and we had to limit our production and to even lay off," explains Karel Zdarsky. </seg>
<seg id="19"> A viable company must know that from time to time should be taken unpopular measures. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But they managed the situation correctly and preserved bénéficiares results even if they were lower than those which they had before the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However in Farmet, they continued without compromise to invest in the research and the development. </seg>
<seg id="22"> "We built with the equipments a training center and with research, reinforced the presentation of the company in living room-exposures international and gained the principal rewards in the national exposures," known as Zdarsky. </seg>
<seg id="23"> All leaves us think that the crisis is behind them. </seg>

<seg id="23"> "At those which use the acool with repetition, it is rather about a socio-family background significantly unfavourable," explained the Head of Pélikan Department. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> According to the Jurinova spokesperson, approximately forty drunk children were hospitalized this year until mid-November in the private clinic of pediatry in Motol. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Are integrated in stastistic only the cases with a grâve intoxication requiring the hospitalization. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The drunk children who are after the care urgently brought back on their premises by the parents or the police, are not counted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> In addition to the cases of the children who assoient and drink an alcohol bottle after the school, it exsite according to Pélikan three seasonal waves which one can take into account: the day of the witches, it holy Sylvestre and the school end of the year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> "Either they drink by spite after bad results or on the contrary they celebrate the beginning of the vacancies." </seg>
<seg id="29"> "Of course I lived at the day of the witches an admission of 7 drunk children at a stretch," Pélikan underlined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> The drunk child who spent the night to the hospital in desintoxciation under medical control is paradoxically in better position than that which returned at his place and suffers the following day from the "hangover." </seg>
<seg id="31"> The headaches of the morning caused by a dehydration and a lack of glucose are eliminated by an infusion from glucose and nutritive elements which the organization needs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> "They for that are parcelled out better since they pass an excellent evening then a soft alarm clock and nothing hurts them." </seg>
<seg id="33"> "They are only astonished by the place where they are," Pélikan knowing adds that from time to time that wastes the good mood of the patients at least with the note to be paid for their care. </seg>
<seg id="34"> Transport by ambulance and the hospitalization on bed of intensive care can go until tens of thousands of crowns. </seg>
<seg id="35"> "From time to time, I applied that as a means of education including to these children how much their intoxication cost and than they could spend all the summer in seasonal work to refund only one evening," Pélikan added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> However, according to him, the insurance companies of health in their managements in regression, which should recover on behalf of the parents the loads related to the care, do not treat the cases of drunk children. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The men who have the index longer than the annular one are exposed at the less risk to have a cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="3"> It is the surprising conclusion of a study published Wednesday by the British magazine Cancer. </seg>
<seg id="4"> That can depend on the level of the male hormone testosterone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "Our conclusions show that the relative length of the finger is used as simple test of risk of cancer of the prostate, in particular for the men before 60 years," the joint author of the study Ros Eeles proclaimed, professor at the Institute for research on cancer at the university of Warwick. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The finger could thus help to determine which men should subject themselves to the test of the cancer of the prostate, in particular while combining with the genetic risk or other factors aggrâvants like the family antecedents of health, added Eeles. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> For the period of 1994-2009 it followed with her colleagues to the United Kingdom more than 1500 patients reached of a cancer of the prostate and at the same time nearly three thousand healthy men. </seg>
<seg id="8"> More half of the participants under investigation had the index of the right hand shorter than the annular one. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> For them as for the 19 percent of those which had the fingers same length, one found the same probability of a cancer of the prostate. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In the case of those which had the index longer than annular the risk however fell to 33 percent, for the men before 60 years the reduction in the risk reached 87 percent. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> One can program the ammunition in such a way that they will explode in contact with the target but also at any point of their ballistic trajectory. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Japanese group Fujitsu delocalizes its branch of Bad Homburg in Frankfurt. </seg>
<seg id="5"> As affirmed it Wednesday the giant specialized in the manufacturing and the maintenance of the computers, the next year in July, the workplace of 400 men and women, located until now on the Marienbader place of the town of Bad Homburg, will be transferred to Astro Park, immense complex of offices located on the street Lyoner Straße of the Niederrad District of Frankfurt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> A spokesperson of Fujitsu explained that in the medium term, the group should gather there 100 other employment still scattered up to now in the area. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The offer of hiring was extremely gravitational. In addition, the offices with open surface of Astro Park are appropriate better for the work method of the collaborators. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In Bad Homburg also, Fujitsu was right tenant. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The chief executive officer, Bernd Wagner, declared: "Frankfurt-Niederrad constitutes for us a paramount site having a remarkable infrastructure." </seg>
<seg id="10"> He affirms that connection to the airport is precisely of great importance for a total company like Fujitsu. </seg>

<seg id="12"> The person in charge of the economic affairs of the municipality of Frankfurt, Mr. Markus Frank (CDU), declared that once again, a "planetary actor" had been thus conquered. </seg>
<seg id="13"> It is a "extraordinary relative profession of faith instead of establishment." </seg>
<seg id="14"> Fujitsu is appropriate for the city and its establishment constitutes an important dash for Niederrad. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The mayor of Bad Homburg, Mr. Michael Korwisi (greens), regrets the decision of Fujitsu. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The direction very early informed the municipality of this intention. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "It goes without saying that we proposed our assistance to this company," Mr. Korwisi declared. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the friendly relations could not anything have changed with the difficulties of the computer maker vis-a-vis the owner of the building of the Marienbader Place. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the final analysis, the economic reasons would have been determining. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It is a question from now on of preventing that a so exceptional place does not remain unoccupied for a long time. </seg>
<seg id="21"> "I have the hope that the owner and financial backer of the building will be co-operative." </seg>
</p>
<p>

<seg id="23"> Fruit of a joint project of the municipality and a private developer of projects, a new entry of the city was created between the station and the Town hall. This one caused many criticisms, not only because of the impressive installation of surfaces which were used formerly partly as carpark, but also because of the height of the buildings. </seg>
<seg id="24"> In 2001, the company of notation and councils in investment, Feri, the computer maker for the delivery systems of the voyages, Start Amadeus, like Fujitsu, computer maker at the time still associated with Siemens, moved in the buildings. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With does the fact, from which come all the ice? </seg>
<seg id="5"> Glacier and machine with ice. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The glacier, i.e. in German the confectioner of ice somewhat become old-fashioned, manufactures the cream according to all the rules of the Italian art of manufacturing of the ice. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The turbine with ice removes the cream of ice of the window cooled using a spatula, lays out it in waffle and then starts to sell it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> For the knowledge, one does not need to go in Anzola dell' Emilia in the province of Bologna. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But whoever wishes to know some more about the ice, cannot avoid "Gelato-University" of the Italian firm Carpigiani. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The manufacturer of the ice-cream freezers founded the university of ice in 2003 so that the creams of ice left its machines answer the high Italian ideals everywhere. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The introductory course three days organized for the future glaciers had a very great success and attracted visitors come from everywhere in the world. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Are also offered special courses relating to the chocolate ice and extending over several days. In the same way, of the practical meetings are organized in the private mirror factory. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In full midlife crisis, a certain number of people dream of a new career, others simply go so far as to carry out their burning desire on the smooth ice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> This time, they are 40 participants come from 19 country of all the continents, of Brazil in Saudi Arabia via Hungary. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Jacky, professor of education artistic come from California is set on the movement Slow Food. He wants in the future to offer a European product of quality to the country of the industrial Ice. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Anke of Berlin east adviser in business management and it wants, after a few years, to draw some thing from singular of this trade testing for the nerves. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Two young Egyptian women dream to open a mirror factory in Cairo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> A man originating in Malta and another come from Brazil would like to improve quality of the ice cream in their bars, and the Canadian cleaning lady came because his/her children adore the Italian ice creams. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The main glacier Luciano Ferrari initially explains to the participants the ideal characteristics of the perfect ices. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Is determining not only good savor, but also the silky flexibility and good consistency. </seg>
<seg id="21"> However, Luciano does not forget during the formation icing on the cake of the national superstructure and, in general, the south: "The Italian ice is simply the best: and then it still preserves one crowned amount of romanticism." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> The first stage in the manufacturing appears completely simple. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Luciano pours the basic ingredients, such as milk, cream, dried milk, sugar and stabilizers in a large mixer which heats all with 85 degrees grace an electronic program, then cools immediately with four degrees. </seg>
<seg id="24"> It opens then a tap installed on the machine: it leaves a pasteurized basic white cream there, base of all the kinds of ices to milk. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The trainer is assailed at once by question: Is it possible to manufacture ice by using only natural substances without stabilizer? </seg>
<seg id="26"> How can one give free course to the personal pleasure of the experimentation? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Mr. Luciano warns against the fact of letting itself induce in error by the spirit of time. </seg>
<seg id="28"> That which speaks only about the ices "manufactured starting from the natural ingredients," perhaps in spite of that used of the stabilizers: generally a natural product, for example of the flour of seed of guar obtained starting from bean of guar. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is obviously possible to manufacture ice without using of stabilizer, only it should be sold within a period of 12 midnight, if not it crumbles and the customer will anything else crunch only granules of ice. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> Certain modifications of the basic mass are allowed. </seg>
<seg id="31"> That becomes more enthralling with the flavors. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The Master Luciano establishes the difference between the ingredients which one acquires in the ray fruits or confectioneries of the supermarket. </seg>
<seg id="33"> Moreover, there exists powder and pastes. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "the suppliers will try all to give you dozen aromatized ingredients." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "However, you should quite simply test." </seg>
<seg id="36"> Maybe in the receipts of sorbets to the fruits with fresh sugar and fruits. </seg>
<seg id="37"> Maybe in the ice creams manufactured starting from the basic mass white which, while adding of eggs becomes a yellow cream and constitutes to it, when one adds cocoa powder to it, the base of all the possible desserts to the chocolate. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> Now, all the participants in the course must pass to the use of the machines to ice. </seg>
<seg id="39"> Luciano from time to time invites them to manufacture four kinds of ices: with vanilla, with the chocolate, the mocha coffee and hazel nut with or without eggs in the basic mass, with more or less of flavor of vanilla or other natural ingredients. </seg>
<seg id="40"> The various kinds of ices to the fruits are also subjected to the same experiment. </seg>
<seg id="41"> More aromatic substances, more fruit mashed potatoes: from the point of view of the taste, that is not absolutely better. </seg>
<seg id="42"> The ice with hazel nuts inevitably does not comprise the taste of nut, when it is composed mainly of hazel nuts. </seg>
<seg id="43"> The ice with kiwi, very popular, is manufactured starting from the group using more fruits, less water and a little less stabilizer. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "Only a balanced mixture correctly raises the taste of an ice," Luciano affirms. </seg>
<seg id="45"> The manufacturing of the ice is a exercise of calculation: if one uses mashed potatoes of fishing with much of sugar, it is necessary that the quantity of sugar is reduced in the basic receipt. </seg>
<seg id="46"> A sugar supplement is necessary for the ice to lemon. </seg>
<seg id="47"> Luciano presents an apparatus with which it determines the sugar content of the various types of fruits (the vine growers make use of it to measure the degree of Oechsle in the grape must). </seg>
<seg id="48"> Fortunately, the tables facilitate calculations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> The manufacturing of the ice does not require any more, like formerly, as much of physical intervention. </seg>
<seg id="50"> It is not only the automatic manufacturing machine tool of the basic mass which helps. </seg>
<seg id="51"> There exists also an apparatus in which one beats simultaneously the mixture of ice available to return it smooth and brought back to negative temperatures. </seg>
<seg id="52"> In spite of all automations, light breakdowns are not excluded. </seg>
<seg id="53"> Brazilian Gustavo smears fruit mashed potatoes of the head to the feet and, thus, splashes his/her fellow students when the control of the colossal mixing bowl escapes to him. </seg>
<seg id="54"> The Master Luciano thinks that a "similar incident is likely to occur at the time of each course: it is only one question of time." </seg>

<seg id="19"> In goods of the sectors, the companies cannot recruit their collaborators any more by carrying out a sorting on a string of candidates. </seg>
<seg id="20"> But they must praise their reliability and especially court the highly qualified labor. </seg>
<seg id="21"> They are especially the graduates from the sectors of engineering which are in an excellent position to negotiate. </seg>
<seg id="22"> According to the association of German engineers VDI, more than 40,000 posts of engineers remained unoccupied in October. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And according to the forecasts of the VDI, the vacuum relating to the posts of engineer will still increase. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> Roman Dykta goes to hunting to the talents on behalf of KPMG, cabinet of audit, accountancy and council. </seg>
<seg id="25"> It organizes expensive events aiming to the recruitment of the talents, as for example the race cruising KPMG-Race, a species of rally-paper where the competitors must find their way using the GPS coordinates. </seg>
<seg id="26"> The company will thus send eight promising students the next year so that they traverse this way the United States. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The participants can incidentally visit the subsidiaries of KPMG and know the company. </seg>
<seg id="28"> That which must take part in it decides in advance after two procedures of selection. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Only the cream of the cream of the many candidates will fly away for the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> According to Mr. Dykta, the means used for the search of the high potentials in the universities are increasingly important. </seg>
<seg id="31"> "We want to emerge from the batch thanks to the race cruising." </seg>
<seg id="32"> "For us, a simple cruising was not enough thing" </seg>
<seg id="33"> For the hunter of talents which is Mr. Dykta, the account seems to be there. </seg>
<seg id="34"> "Until today, we stayed in touch with all the people having taken share last year with a similar action." </seg>
<seg id="35"> "Some of them are about to finish their studies and wish to address soon their requests to our company." affirm it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> Apart from the direct softening carried out in the campus, the small and medium-size companies proceed in a completely traditional way while taking part in the professional fairs where they are delivered to hunting for the brains. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "We try to reach the graduates while taking part in the trade shows." </seg>
<seg id="38"> "For example, with the living room of solar technologies," indicates Mrs. Sitha Stübe, director of human resources at Solarworld, manufacturer of photovoltaic panels. </seg>
<seg id="39"> This company installed in Bonn employs approximately 1500 people in Germany. </seg>
<seg id="40"> Mrs. Stübe is aware of the problems related to the changing. </seg>
<seg id="41"> Currently, 35 stations are put at the competition based on the site of the company. </seg>
<seg id="42"> "In this moment, it is very difficult to provide with the vacant posts." </seg>
<seg id="43"> "Is That expensive and takes much time," does ensure? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="44"> Another means of establishing the contact consists in passing through the professors of university. </seg>
<seg id="45"> Solarworld established a co-operation with various higher education educational establishments, for example, the university of Freiburg. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "The professors indicate that the student has the possibility of carrying out professional training courses or on our premises to write its project of end of study." </seg>
<seg id="47"> Expensive publicity campaigns are announced in the specialists in the solar one. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Therefore the company tries to make its publicity by putting forward other qualities: personalized environment, hierarchy punt and easy communication. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "Often, a great group cannot do that," supports Mrs. Stübe, personnel officer. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> A long time ago that the money does not hold any more the main role in the job search. </seg>
<seg id="51"> The flexible work hours, the child care or of good possibilities of promotion constitute the other determining factors. </seg>
<seg id="52"> According to a study conducted by the institute Great Places to Work, Solarworld occupies the 55e place among the 100 best employers of Germany. </seg>
<seg id="53"> The institute constitutes an annual honnor roll of the German employers. </seg>
<seg id="54"> For this purpose, he questions the collaborators on their satisfaction degree compared to their work and to his context while looking at the condition-frameworks of the employees. </seg>
<seg id="55"> The personnel officer Mrs. Stübe hopes that this placement will make it possible to raise the image of the company near the job-seekers. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "I think that the candidates rely especially on the external evaluations with regard to a potential employer," she declares. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="57"> Wolf Reiner Kriegler of German academy DEBA (Deutscher To employ Branding Akademie, DEBA) advises the companies which wish to build a good reputation as an employer by applying a long-term strategy. </seg>
<seg id="58"> He advises with his customers to show more authenticity. </seg>
<seg id="59"> And, according to Mr. Kriegler, that means above all to take internal measures. </seg>
<seg id="60"> "The best means for an employer of making itself gravitational is to pass through his/her clean collaborators," he affirms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> That is called, according to the jargon used in the sector, the internal strategy of image, i.e. the creation of the brand image of the employer within his own manpower. </seg>
<seg id="62"> "the satisfied collaborators train the best messengers." </seg>
<seg id="63"> When his employees well are treated and that they are identified with the company, they make only the publicity of their employer near their friends and knowledge. </seg>
<seg id="64"> "It is as if one played in an orchestra," Mr. Kriegler declares. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Is the Splatter film an artificial film? </seg>
<seg id="3"> The director Nicolas Winding Refn explores the limits of the old kind thanks to his film, "Walhalla Rising," epopee of the combatant. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> With which public the Danish director Nicolas Winding Refn it could well think while turning "Walhalla Rising"? </seg>
<seg id="5"> A warrior Viking (Mads Mikkelsen) not having that an eye is made prisoner\; he releases himself from his torturer and, with an almost supernatural force, eliminates his adversaries the ones after the others. That seems ideal for the young male spectators in search of a bloody action, precisely because our hero uses brutal methods of assassination. When it is of bad mood, it tears off the intestines of its enemies without waiting until those died. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> On another side, until the end of film, the one-eyed one does not say any word on its true name. Even the other characters let escape, at most, with the turning of one or two sentences some cries of anguish terrible. </seg>
<seg id="7"> If not, one says nothing and one feasts in the incredibly beautiful mountainous landscape of Scotland which constitutes the decoration of the universe of the Vikings, approximately thousand years ago. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It would be ideal more the mature scenario writers having an interest for the existentialism and the excellent dollies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> When a film aims several group-targets, it is damage that those are excluded mutually. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The director Winding Refn is considered, since the publication of "Pusher tractor," his trilogy relating to the drug trafficker savage and full with style, like a kind of Quentin Tarantinon Danish, but he refuses to bring a little more mood to the current dominating or to introduce a little less brutality with the cinema of art and test. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Most sympathizers of the cinema of art must test horror vis-a-vis the brain which is spread around and with the intestines. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The avid film-goers of action die of trouble, when the one-eyed one embarks, for reasons which one can freely interpret, with a group of Christian missionaries violent one in a ship bound for Jerusalem\; they are drowned during an eternity by the calm and the fog before the crew arrives to America and continues to keep silent itself. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> It is not then astonishing that "Walhalla Rising" did not find any film distributer in Germany and that there does not exist that under format DVD. </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is especially because of splendid images of the misery which deserved a certain attention, but also because the image of a palpitating film, time with other, hides behind a pretentious and bloody appearance. </seg>
<seg id="15"> They are not dialogs in this film, nor of a coherent action, all is environment, a feverish dream transformed into film. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The spectator cannot escape from it. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Refn grants hardly a moment to him of relaxation and crosses to him slowly the throat with icy images and a lugubrious soundtrack, but especially with an imperceptible hatred which spouts out heart of the characters. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Only a young fair boy, who is held accurately at the sides of the one-eyed one, preserves a certain innocence, all the others are animated by anger. </seg>
<seg id="19"> More than all, the one-eyed hero whose mobiles are never known, but which returns from the hell constantly to fight enemies and temporarily allies while being transformed into warrior, is perhaps as an envoy of the devil itself. </seg>
<seg id="20"> It represents rotting, but perhaps also, only for those which are, in any way, rotted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "Walhalla Rising" is an enigmatic film which one can hate or admire, who has as a finality the irritation, enthusiasm and astonishment. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Love in time of war </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> That is badly since Angelina Jolie made her beginnings in summer as a director. </seg>
<seg id="3"> She wrote the scenario itself: it is a history of love between a woman originating in Bosnia and a Serb man of origin. </seg>
<seg id="4"> One knows nothing more about this history, but that is enough to cause discomfort. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A persistent rumor indicates that the woman, a Muslim, fell in love with her Serb torturer during the war with Yugoslavia. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The federations of the Bosnian women immediately protested. In answer, certain sequences of turning envisaged in Sarajevo were moved at the last minute in Hungary. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Meanwhile, the film is made to Hungary, but in the phase of post-production, the protests always continue in Bosnia. </seg>
<seg id="8"> According to the information published in a Bosnian newspaper, Bakira Hasecic of the organization of the women war victims addressed a correspondence to Angelina Jolie through High Commission of the United Nations for the refugees (UNHCR) and it required to meet the actress. Pretty ambassador of good will of the UNHCR is itself. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It is not diplomatic. A few weeks ago already, it proposed to these women to hold a meeting with them in Hungary, but those declined this offer. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "The meeting must be held in Bosnia," Hasecic affirms. </seg>
<seg id="11"> There no were stories of love in the concentration camps, and the scenario of Pretty into known as rather long on its attitude towards the victims. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Guardian reports that the organization of Hasecic has, thereafter, recommended to the High Commission of the United Nations to withdraw the quality of ambassador of good will with Angelina Jolie. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But, with the fact, which kind of Jolie scenario did she write? </seg>
<seg id="14"> The Bosnian ministry of the culture, which received copies of its scenario, granted after some hesitations an authorization of turning in Sarajevo, but one does not know why did not then come in spite of this authorization. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The young author ensures itself that she does not pursue political goals with her film, that it is by doing many efforts that she briefing herself of the Yugoslav conflict. It supports that it wants to put forward the terrible consequences of the war and to give the possibility to all the parts fascinating of being expressed. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> It remains however vague about the contents. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Thus a second synopsis of film circulates on the Net. It is rather different: The in love ones knew each other well before the beginning of the war. It meet again when the woman, a Bosnian Muslim, is off-set in the concentration camp Serbe where the man works as guard. </seg>
<seg id="18"> What constitutes all the same a great difference with the version "a victim of rape amourache of its torturer." </seg>
<seg id="19"> That the film of Pretty started well before the war, of course. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The pressure which is exerted on it, thus is expressed Jolie, been "unjust and founded on erroneous information." </seg>
<seg id="21"> From now on, only the fanatics of Hollywood can get peace to him: By illegally putting this scenario in the Net, like good of others before. </seg>

<seg id="39"> Since six months, Seán O' Donovan, what means being based knows elsewhere. </seg>
<seg id="40"> As there was nothing any more to make in Ireland for this 29 year old engineer, it works from now on with 15 Irish colleagues in the sector of construction E Germany. </seg>
<seg id="41"> A house of mode precisely leaves ground in Gelsenkirchen. </seg>
<seg id="42"> In January, it will continue to work on other projects Hanover or Berlin. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> Meanwhile, O' Donovan visits only seldom his land native, because it takes part in an additional work station, in order to be able to complete to refund the credit contracted to build its house with the native land. </seg>
<seg id="44"> "The situation is already a little nutcase," he affirms by crossing the threshold of his house for the first time after a long time. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "I earn money in Germany to build a house in Ireland where I do not live practically any more." </seg>
<seg id="46"> It bursts of a laughter embarrassed while crossing the cold rooms. </seg>
<seg id="47"> The small house is in a residential zone with quite neat gardens of front, expensive cars of famous brands are stationed on the access roads. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Four years ago, O' Donovan bought the house in common with his sister for an amount of 380.000 Euros, financed with 100 pourcent by the credit. </seg>
<seg id="49"> "They was moments of madness, without any doubt, the money was easy," he affirms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="50"> Is he afraid to very see collapsing because of credit? </seg>
<seg id="51"> O' Donovan reflects one moment, is used again of the hot tea and declares: "I do not have children to maintain and I am young\; even all goes from through, I can set out again to zero." </seg>
<seg id="52"> The engineer of the building does not like the lamentations that he hears often lately. </seg>
<seg id="53"> "Nobody must suffer from the hunger, our situation is nevertheless not as dramatic as what one lived formerly here in the island," supports it. </seg>
<seg id="54"> "To work during one moment abroad, it is not what can do without worse, perhaps it is what that we feel initially Irish. </seg>
<seg id="55"> He laughs and speaks then about his father who went to England at the time of the last great economic crisis. </seg>

<h1>
<seg id="1"> The democratic routine </seg>
</h1>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The support for the democracy in Latin America continues to increase, just like that at the private company. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The crime became greater concern than unemployment. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And Brazil is seen like more influential than the United States in most of the area. </seg>
<seg id="5"> They are there certain conclusions of the last Latinobarómetro survey taken in 18 countries and published of exclusiveness by The Economist. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Being given that the survey was carried out systematically since 1995, it follows the changes of attitude in the area. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Two dependant elements arise from the results of the survey of this year, carried out in September and at at the beginning of October. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The first is the rather sunny mood of the Latin America. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The second is the increasing stability of the attitudes towards the democracy and his principal institutions. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The support for the democracy increased appreciably in several countries on the circumference of the Pacific of South America (see table 1). </seg>
<seg id="11"> For example to Peru, where the economic growth reached on average 6% a year since 2002, the support for the democracy passed from a minimum of 40% in 2005 to 61% this year. </seg>
<seg id="12"> It also increased in Mexico, where the economy was rectified after having undergone a strong fall of the production last year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> But only approximately half of the guarantors in Mexico and Brazil, the two most populated countries area, are convinced democrats, which cause a drop in the regional average (see table 2). </seg>
<seg id="14"> Some 44% of the guarantors of the area were declared satisfied in the way in which the democracy of their country functioned in practice\; it acts of the same figure as last year but with a strong increase on the 25% in 2001 (graphic 3) </seg>
<seg id="15"> Some 34% said that they had confidence in the Parliament from their country and 45% in their government, the same ones as last year in both cases\; but in big rise compared to 2003 (respectively 17% and 24%). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Ten years ago, the economic problems in Latin America shook the support for the democracy. </seg>
<seg id="17"> If that held good during the world financial crisis, it is certainly due to the fact that the many ones of country of America underwent only one short recession and profited from a strong recovery. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Moreover, a network of social security contributed to protect the poor. </seg>
<seg id="19">  (The Economic commission of the United Nations for the Latin America brought back this week that the proportion of the Latin americans living in poverty increased only lowered this year slightly in 2009 and again, to 32%.) </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> But mood varies considerably from one country to another (cf graph 4). </seg>
<seg id="21"> The economic good performances of Brazil and the popularity of its outgoing president, Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva, results in a largely shared feeling of progress </seg>
<seg id="22"> What is rarer in Mexico and in Central America where the recession was more severe and where the crimes violent one worsened. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> It is only for the second time since the survey started that more guarantors through the Latin America as a whole quoted the crime rather than unemployment as being the most important problem for their country (see table 5). </seg>
<seg id="24"> Approximately 31% say that themselves or one of their close relation were victim of a criminal act during the past year\; nevertheless, this figure is in fall compared to the 38% last year and is low since 1995. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> A more robust economic performance is reflected in the rise of support for the private company and the market economy: approximately 71% of the guarantors of the area say that the private company is essential for the development, against 56% in 2007 (cf graph 6). </seg>
<seg id="26"> Some 58% estimate that the market economy is the only system which will return their country developed, against 47% last year. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Interesting fact, 62% of the guarantors in Venezuela are of this opinion (and 80% support the private company) \; even if their president of left, Hugo Chavez, expropriates of many private companies. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> Brazil is the largest leader in the area, mentioned by 19% of the questioned people (against 18% last year), followed by the United States (9%, unchanged compared to last year) and Venezuela (9%, in fall of 11% since last year) </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the United States is regarded as the most influential country by the guarantors in Mexico and in most of the Central America, while Venezuela enjoys this distinction in Ecuador, Dominican Republic and in Nicaragua. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Nobody expected to have perfect general elections in Haiti on November 28th. </seg>
<seg id="3"> But it was quite worse than the outsiders who wanted to help the country disaster victim and plunged in fear. </seg>
<seg id="4"> One presented boxes of poll and a new poll, paper ballots dispersed in the goutières, of the ransacked polling stations and the intimidations </seg>
<seg id="5"> The polling stations opened the evening late. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Much Hatïens, including the many ones which was moved following the earthquake of January, wandered in the vicinity to find where to vote. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Some of them ended up giving up. </seg>
<seg id="8"> A dozen candidates with the presidential election, whose several supposed favorites, denounced the fraud and claimed the cancellation of the election. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Protests, sometimes violent, exploded through the country. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Nevertheless, Edmond Mule, the high official in Haiti of the United Nations Organization, regards the event as "a rather good election with many regards." </seg>
<seg id="11"> Observers of the Organization of the American States and the Community of the Caribbean declared prudently that they "did not believe that these irregularities, so serious are, had necessarily invalidated the process." </seg>
<seg id="12"> In other words, the spectacle continues. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The electoral authority, whose opponents are indebted to Rene Préval, unpopular outgoing president, and with its candidate, Jude Célestin, must announce the preliminary results on December 7th. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The second expected turn is scheduled for January. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Any hope in the election is not lost. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Two candidates of the opposition, Michel Martelly, a musician of rap, and Mirlande Manigat, an old first lady, were withdrawn from their initial call so that the vote is declared null. </seg>
<seg id="17"> But there can be problems if Mr. Célestin, who has little or not perceptible support among voters, is declared by the electoral authority as having reached to it second will toura reached the second turn. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> With a cholera epidemic which rages, and more than 1 million survivors to the earthquake who still live in tents, one feared that the participation would be. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In fact, many Haitians wanted to vote but were prevented from doing it because of the disorganization. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Nearly 250,000 identity cards, necessary to vote, little time before the election was not distributed yet. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The challenge is important. </seg>
<seg id="22"> The givers see the election of a popular and legitimate government like a big step in the rebuilding of Haiti. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The point of the feet towards the center </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The weeks after being become suddenly widowed, Cristina Fernández, president of Argentina, profited from a wave of sympathy of the public which improved its rate of approval of 20 points, to more than 50%\; it is about sound plus high level since she was elected in 2007. </seg>
<seg id="3"> However, to transform that into a campaign successful for a second mandate at the time of an election the next year could depend on the choice of Mrs. Fernández, obviously in mourning, according to which it would give up or not the intransigence of her late husband, predecessor and former political partner, Néstor Kirchner. </seg>
<seg id="4"> And, on this subject, the signs remain confused. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Mr. Kirchner, who continued to manage the economic policy, even after his wife succeeds to him as president, was accustomed to working out budgets which underestimated the revenues from taxes, the economic growth and inflation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That made it possible the first couple to at will spend the additional incomes. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The government of Mrs. Fernández lost her majority with the Congress last year, on paper. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But the opposition is divided, and the situation sank in the distress following the death of Mr. Kirchner of a heart attack on October 27th. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Some of the dissenting members of the movement peronist to the power joined with Mrs. Fernández. </seg>
<seg id="10"> But after chaotic meetings (where a member of Parliament struck with the face one of its pars and where others showed the government of corruption), the Congress does not have to approve the budget 2011. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> "I will not dispute," the president stated. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Currently, the budget 2010 will be applied the next year, leaving to the president still a greater maneuver margin to spend at will. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The economy largely overheats: it is likely to grow of almost 9% this year. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The official rate of inflation accounts now for 11.1% but many private estimates and the salary demands of the trade unions, see this figure close to 30%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Mr. Kirchner, which took up its post in 2003 when Argentina feared an economic collapse, made a priority of the growth and reduction of poverty, rather than of the control of inflation. </seg>
<seg id="16"> He refused to treat with the IMF, he badgered the private sector and purged the INDEC, the statistical office, which carried out falsifications of statistics on official inflation. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Can Mrs. Fernández now moderate these policies? </seg>
<seg id="18"> It called with talks between the private companies and the trade union leaders. </seg>
<seg id="19"> And its civils servant say that they want to limit pay rises the next year to 18%. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> The economy was stimulated by high world prices of agricultural exports of Argentina. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But inflation eroded the nudge in the right direction with the growth following a strong devaluation in 2002. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It is perhaps the reason for which Mrs. Fernández shows signs to want to restore the financial relations of Argentina towards the rest of the world. </seg>
<seg id="23"> This year, the government concluded an agreement with the bond-holders who had refused a former reorganization forced of the debt for which Argentina had not regulated its expiries in 2001. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Now ms Fernández seems to Be edging towards year agreement with creditor governments grouped in the Paris Club, to which it owes nap $6.7 billion. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Kirchner always insisted on the fact that it could not imply a monitoring by the IMF, as it is of habit. </seg>
<seg id="26"> But last month, Amado Boudou, the Minister of Economy, announced that the Funds would provide a "technical assistance" to conceive a new national index of the consumer prices\; what resembles a prelude of the cleansing of the INDEC. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> It is not clear if Mrs. Fernández wants to remain in the policy beyond the end of her mandate, now that her husband is not any more at his sides. </seg>
<seg id="28"> If it does it, it has need to gain support of the middle class, among which the kirchnerism is very preached. </seg>
<seg id="29"> When the Argentinian ones return their summer holidays in March, the wave of sympathy to it will have ebbed. </seg>
<seg id="30"> If she wants to gain another election, she will have to decide to repudiate or not, without noise, of many policies of her husband. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> To carry out at the request of a president, and people are required to become acquainted. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Esperanza Spalding, the bass player of jazz and singer 26 year old gathered with the hand by president Obama to occur at the time of its ceremony of the Nobel Prize of Peace in 2009, marked one of the surprises of the Grammy Awards this year with a nomination of great scale in the category of the "best new artist." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Considering that Spalding is a figure very known on the scene of the jazz since its album of 2008, "Esperanza," the nomination remains a little mysterious but it is compatible with the rules of the Grammy Awards according to which an artist should not leave more than three albums before the recording\; what "proves the public identity of this artist." </seg>
<seg id="5"> Its ambitious album of 2010, "Chamber Society Music," marked certainly a step ahead and, being given its vocal style slightly engaging, its skilful hand the pop one and of funk and its Latin influences, it is possible to draw at least a dotted line with Spalding compared to the fulgurating success of Norah Jones in 2003, the equivalent nearest for the voters to the Grammy Awards by taking account of the productions of jazz in this category these last years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Elsewhere, the voters of the Grammy Awards rightly honoured "Historicity" with Vijay Iyer Trio in the category "album instrumental," one transferred on a reinvigorating shiver of a recording which was one of the paramount favorites last year. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Society secrecy of the savage Darcy James Wire-drawer, familiarized with the steampunk, gained some recognitions deserved well in the category great unit\; competing with the rich chamber-jazz of Billy Childs Together and the adventurous eternal Dave Holland whose album "Pathways" of sound octet' S live was a good example of the democratic hand of this bass player as a team leader. </seg>

<seg id="1"> A microbe tolerating arsenic raises the possibility of new types of lives on Earth, or elsewhere. </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The discovery of a strange bacterium, which can use arsenic like one of its nutritive elements, widens the field to find new forms of life on Earth and perhaps beyond. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> Although the researchers discovered the unusual bacterium here on Earth, they say that shows that the life has possibilities beyond the major elements which were regarded as essential. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> "This organization has a double capacity." </seg>
<seg id="5"> "It can developed either with phosphorus, or with arsenic." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "This is why it is very particular, even if it is far from being "a foreign" form of life really, Paul Davies C.W commented on. University of State of Arizona, joint author of the report appearing in the online edition of Thursday of the Science newspaper. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Six major elements were regarded a long time as essential for the life: carbon, hydrogen, nitrogen, oxygen, phosphorus and sulfur. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> But the researchers discovered that the bacterium, discovered in the lake Mono, in California, is able to continue to develop after having replaced phosphorus by arsenic. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "One wonders what is still possible," declared Ariel Anbar D. of the University of State of Arizona, joint author of the report. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The discovery is important as regards research of the life beyond the Earth because the researchers must be able to recognize the life, of knowing it with what the life resembles, says Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The study concentrates on a microbe found on Earth. </seg>
<seg id="12"> However, the announcement of a press conference to discuss it, which did not reveal the details of the lucky find, generated speculations spread on the Internet according to which the report could reveal the discovery of an extraterrestrial life. </seg>
<seg id="13"> That was not the case. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The discovery "shows that, in other planetary environments, the organizations could be able to use other elements to actuate biochemistry and that "the standard" whole of the elements, that we judge absolutely necessary for the life, could not be fixed," commented on Charles Cockell, professor at the planetary scientific Research institute and spacial, Open University, Milton Keynes, the United Kingdom. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Cockell was not part of the research team. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "This work is new because it shows the substitution of an element to another in fundamental biochemistry and biochemical structure," Cockell added. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> It was not a fortuitous discovery. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> Felisa Wolfe-Simon of the Institute of Astrology of NASA, which directed the study, chose the lake Mono because it is equipped with arsenic elevated levels. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Arsenic and phosphorus are chemically similar\; thus, she speculated that a microbe exposed to the two substances could be able to substitute one for the other. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> "Arsenic is toxic mainly because its chemical behavior is really similar to that of phosphorus." </seg>
<seg id="21"> "Consequently, the organizations have difficulty distinguishing these elements separately." </seg>
<seg id="22"> "But arsenic is sufficiently different so that it does not function exactly as phosphorus\; it penetrates inside and, to some extent, gums the work of our biochemical machine," explained Anbar. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The researchers collected the bacterium known under the name of GFAJ-1 and exposed it to increasing arsenic concentrations to which it could adapt and grow. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The microbe grows better with phosphorus but the fact that it can live with arsenic in the place raises the possibility that a form of life using arsenic can occur naturally, that is to say elsewhere on Earth or another planet or the moon where arsenic is more frequent. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Jamy S. Foster, assistant professor of microbiology at the University of Florida, said that the idea, according to which arsenic could be replaced by phosphorus, was not new\; but nothing never showed that could go. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> Arsenic was more frequent at the beginning of the existence of the Earth, she says\; thus, the researchers put forth the hypothesis that the first forms of life could have used it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> That suggests that there could be other ways of forming the life, not only the way in which the life on Earth was formed at the beginning," Foster declared, which was not part of the research team of Wolfe-Simon. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> Tang Shenbin surveyed a place of the city like one sergeant urban with the training by inspecting its nervous loads severely, while emitting with low voice of the orders with military authorities. </seg>
<seg id="3"> He wanted that the female members of chengguan - responsible imposing for the public order in China, feared and scorned for their arbitrary repression and their leaning for violence - transmit a certain impression to a set of spectators. </seg>
<seg id="4"> "You Hold right!" </seg>
<seg id="5"> "Be piercing!" </seg>
<seg id="6"> Show, he tells them, "what resemble the pretty girls!" </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Four girls having hardly passed adolescence out of white gloves, dressed in jackets and identical pants of color olive, solidified with the attention. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Four pairs of black shoes with heel, rows with the rule. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Four looked after hats perfectly perched at the top of hair attached by a node striped in blue and white. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> "Personally, I think that they have an average appearance," Mr. Tang said, with scorn. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "The models are pretty." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> More than one government tried to refresh the image of the urban inspectors of China. </seg>
<seg id="13"> A city required that all the new recruits have a diploma of higher learning. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The province of Guangdong exchanged the greenish grey of the uniforms against a blue supposedly more engaging. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Wuhan, in central China, replaced the lower-the-eyes by the strong manner:: in 2009, a report announced that 50 officers had encircled an unverifiable snack bar carriage while launching black looks, firmly during half an hour, until the hawker packs up again his business and leaves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> Xindu, an urban district of 680,000 inhabitants with Chengdu, chose to make a great operation of image. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Since 2003, the district supplemented its police of street in urban environment of 13 women, especially selected for their appearance, their contour and their young age. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The idea is to give to the trimmed police a softer side, more female. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> Unfortunately, even Scarlett Johansson could have difficulties in attracting the glance on this underground urban brigade of China </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> And due, the critics will say. </seg>
<seg id="21"> Contrary to the police, these agents are authorized to only make respect the municipal ordinances by imposing administrative fines or other sanctions. </seg>
<seg id="22"> But the Chinese media depict the news of a different reality. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> In January 2008, the inspectors of the province of Hubei beat with died an observer after it used its cellphone to film them dispersing a protest against a discharge of waste. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Last year, a training manual for the inspectors of Beijing, concealed and put on line, described how to overcome the delinquents without emitting effectively blood. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> "Chengguan marked the government," last year regretted China Daily, a national publication, after an umpteenth polemic on the tactics. </seg>
<seg id="28"> The newspaper claimed a "true complete cleaning." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> The skepticals say that the approach is well far. </seg>
<seg id="30"> After the district passed an announcement to find in October eight new recruits female, a leading article, published in The Beijing Evening News, wondered whether the women had real tasks or if they were only one tourist entertainment. </seg>
<seg id="31"> The answer seems to be a little of both. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The announcement of the district required female, old candidates between 18 to 22 years, to have a beautiful silhouette and "the five features of the face in good the order." </seg>
<seg id="33"> They must have a size higher than the average, that is to say of 1.6 meters or 5 feet, 2 ½ inches. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="34"> The retirement at 26 years is obligatory. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The officers declared that work was physically too painful for the women of more than 25 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> "It is their image which is important," a certain officer of district said to Rednet.com, a Web site quasi-governmental. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "Firstly, qualities external of the candidates will determine if they agree\; it is the size, the weight, the features of the face, etc" </seg>
<seg id="38"> Then the temperament and "interior qualities come." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="39"> The women of Chengguan are like vases with flowers, he said, adding: "Besides being vases, they will have other responsibilities. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="40"> Zheng Lihua, assistant editor of the office of management of the district of the city, does not adhere to this description. </seg>
<seg id="41"> But it noted that the requirements concerning the height were the standard standard in many Chinese job offers for the two sexes. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Such is the case of the requirement relating to the order of the features of the face. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="43"> That that means beautiful is a subject of debate among the Chinese. </seg>
<seg id="44"> Admittedly, the handicapped or disfigured people should not postulate. </seg>
<seg id="45"> "We cannot leave a person who limps or uneven to come to be useful here," Mr. Zheng says. </seg>
<seg id="46"> "It would not give a good image." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Liu Yi, which patrols on the Baoguang place close to a monastery, is old of 22 and finely has the dappled cheeks with a mouth curved. </seg>
<seg id="48"> She does not regard the development of her appearance as being sexist, At she said. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="49"> "Do you Think that I have the sexy air in this uniform?" she asked of a disillusioned air. </seg>
<seg id="50"> Xu Yang, his/her colleague with the 21 years old small cavities, known as: "Our work is to present the image of the city." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="51"> They are not opposed so that their mandate is limited, they said, because they nourish greater ambitions of career than simply to drive out the salesmen in the lanes where they are supposed to limit their activities. </seg>
<seg id="52"> Each morning, the team faces a dozen travelling merchants who move quickly on foot or with bicycle, while trying as much as possible to sell rolls or bowls of tofu before running away. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="53"> "Main Wang, you must leave." </seg>
<seg id="54"> "We already told you several times!" , Mrs. Xu said whereas a salesman fled on foot, giving up her bicycle-cart with noodles temporarily. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="55"> The agents rather describe their functions like monotonous that difficult. </seg>
<seg id="56"> "It is about the same thing each day," declared Huang Jing, 20 years old, which studies marketing after work. </seg>
<seg id="57"> "Great routine." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="58"> One of the reasons is that the female agents do not have the power of their male counterparts to confiscate the goods of the salesmen. </seg>
<seg id="59"> They can only threaten to announce the contraveners to their male superiors. </seg>
<seg id="60"> That tends to protect them from the exposures public sudden of animosity against the bureaucracy which are common in all China. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="61"> This year, of the hundreds of citizens with Kunming, the capital of the province of Yunnan, revolted after the propagation of false rumors according to which the agents of the chengguan had killed a salesman. </seg>
<seg id="62"> In one night, more than a dozen police officers and agents of the chengguan were wounded, 14 vehicles of the government were reversed or put at fire. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="63"> Xindu has escaped up to now with such a violence. </seg>
<seg id="64"> But calms it is hardly guaranteed. </seg>
<seg id="65"> Just two blocks of houses of the placid Baoguang place, where the officers of female sex patrolled this morning, more than 50 people gathered with the corner of the street. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="66"> The agents confiscated a motor bike which was being repaired on the pavement rather than in a store, like theirs imposes the regulation. </seg>
<seg id="67"> The owner of the motor bike shouted with the scandal. </seg>
<seg id="68"> A 15 minute old arm wrestling followed before the police officers, with the sinister face, cut through a path with blows of elbow towards their vehicle and left at any speed with the motor bike and its owner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="69"> Li Xuedong, 40 years, a coordinator attached to the male team, remained behind, its white badge turned over to hide its name. </seg>
<seg id="70"> Like the officers of female sex, the coordinators - 40 years old men or more - play a part of support purely. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="71"> Contrary to them, they are not formed in order to maintain an image waxed. </seg>

<seg id="1"> The call of Cheshire will point towards Twitter </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Half a dozen between them were typing with far in the lines of the courtroom. </seg>
<seg id="3"> They sent every minute of the horrible reports of testimonies via Twitter. </seg>
<seg id="4"> At the end, defense said that there was more than 140,000 messages on the lawsuit of the rape case and the children attached to their bed in a house which was burnt. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Thursday, the lawsuit largely followed by Steven J. Beam, which was recognized guilty of the murder of three Cheshire family members, in Connecticut, should lead to an official end where the judge would impose the capital punishment, voted by the jury. </seg>
<seg id="6"> But the lawyers of Mr. Hayes have already to deposit elements with the court which outline arguments of call, likely to occupy the courts during years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> What is aggressive, it is that the intense reports on the lawsuit - as well as use the generalized and extended by the journalists of Twitter - created a "atmosphere of circus," a so widespread and instantaneous saturation with details flamers which the jury was badly influenced by passions of the public. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The request could push the judges of call to be discussed on the question of knowing if new technologies require new rules in the courtrooms. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I made of it the experiment at the time of this lawsuit\; I think that there is a real danger, the introduction of new technologies into the courtrooms undermines the rights of the person to a fair trial," Thomas J. Ullmann, lawyer of Mr. Hayes, chief lawyer declared. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The judge of the lawsuit, Jon C. Blue of the Superior court of State, laconically rejected the claims in the judgment made the week last, affirming that the media "were carefully controlled" and that there was no proof according to which the jury would have been animated by passion. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> But that does not seem to be the last word on the question. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The courses of call recognize decades since that the media coverage of the notorious cases can raise questions about the equity of a lawsuit. </seg>
<seg id="13"> In a judgment of 1966 which made date, the Supreme court of the United States cancelled the judgment of an osteopath of Cleveland, Dr. Sam Shepard, for the assassination of his wife, supporting in her decision that there was a "atmosphere of carnival to the lawsuit" because of media. </seg>
<seg id="14"> The crime is considered by certain to have been the inspiration for the TV program and film "the fugitive one." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Certain lawyers declared that the courts of call seized to re-examine a half century later the judgment of Mr. Hayes can be curious being given the argument according to which new rules could be necessary to manage the means of communication of the courtrooms, unimaginable at the time of the case of Dr. Sheppard. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> "It there has a general reason to worry about the impact of the new media" in the lawsuits of great scale, declared John J. Donohue III, a professor at the school of Right of Stanford which studied the capital punishment in Connecticut and wrote a report according to which she was arbitrarily applied. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Professor Donohue affirms that certain judges of call could be intrigued by the idea according to which the limitation of the instantaneous communication starting from the courtrooms could allow lawsuits righter. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The case of Twitter only one among many others is described of it by lawyers of Mr. Hayes, likely to be discussed during years\; what delays the execution. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="19"> The defense counsels also affirm, for example, that Mr. Hayes would have suffered an injury when Blue judge refused to allow them to put to the test the reactions of the potential jurors in their showing macabre photographs of criminal scenes during the selection of the jury. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Some of sworn stated to be horrified by the photographs at the victims, Jennifer Hawke-Small, 48 years, and his/her daughters, Hayley, 17 years, and Michaela, 11 years. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The defense counsels affirm that they also will dispute the constitutionality of the capital punishment and that they will support that the judge wrongfully expelled one of sworn, which had been critical in front of the prosecutors, and which it wrongly put the pressure for a verdict by making the unusual decision to lead the jury to deliberate in one weekend. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Sworn were not sequestered. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> But their arguments on the effect of the intense media coverage of the lawsuit could be the greatest source of interest. </seg>
<seg id="24"> They noted in a dispute against the verdict, deposited last month, that the case dominated the media scene in Connecticut and that he was discussed during the electoral campaign by the candidates at the station of governor and the Senate of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> They maintained that the data-processing media did not cease poking the flames of the emotion of the business. </seg>
<seg id="26"> "The daily scuffle of the tweets of the media, the cameras and the journalists in front of the law courts," the lawyers wrote, "did not resemble nothing of what had been seen before here, in New Haven, and perhaps even with the national scale." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="27"> Their accent on the cover of the Twitter system is discussed. </seg>
<seg id="28"> In the interviews, certain journalists declared that the assertion, according to whom the instantaneous news was more flamers than the official statements given more slowly, was a sight luddist which would impoverish the policy of the Court governing the media coverage of the future lawsuits. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="29"> But certain lawyers declared that the courses of call étaitent often attracted by the arguments according to which the social and technological changes required an adaptation by the courts. </seg>
<seg id="30"> The lawyers of Mr. Hayes insist on this claim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> In their file, they make a reference to the decision of the Supreme court of 1966 which had reversed the judgment of Dr. Sheppard because of the media coverage of the lawsuit and they specified that they would call upon the need for new rules for the new media. </seg>
<seg id="32"> "This business," they wrote ," that of Sheppard v. Maxwell of the 21e century represents. " </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The police and the Federal security service carry out enormous rackets which contribute to explain the high cost of the life in Moscow, he said. </seg>
<seg id="4"> They collect money not only of legitimate companies but also of organized criminal groups. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Each layer of the bureaucracy - what the Prime Minister Vladimir Putin called the "vertical of the power" - takes its share whereas the money walks on to the top of the scale. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The memorandum, which was sent to Washington under the name of the Ambassador John Beyrle, was posted Wednesday by Wikileaks on its Web site. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The note is based on sources whose names were expurgated. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It was written whereas Iouri Loujkov was still mayor of Moscow\; and it is mainly held responsible for corruption. </seg>
<seg id="9"> It was dismissed in October by president Dmitri Medvedev but there since then were little traces of cleaning. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Loujkov and his wife, Elena Batourina, who has a building firm of foreground, always denied the accusations of corruption during years\; and it gained several lawsuits in defamation on these charges. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In September, he declared what follows to a Russian TV channel, when it was questioned on documentary suggesting that it was corrupted: "It is insane, it is to throw, it is anything." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The Russians believe, with one crushing majority, that their company is corrupted\; according to the surveys. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But it is unusual to find the information stated in a report of embassy\; and it is amazing to conceive that would be to diplomats of a foreign country to do it. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The direct link drawn up between the government of the town of Moscow and the crime led certain people to name it the "dysfunctional one" and to affirm that the government functioned more like a kleptocratie that a government," according to the note of the embassy. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "The criminal elements enjoy a" krysha " (term used in the world criminel/la Mafia which literally means" roof "or protection) which passes through the police, the Federal security service (FSB), the ministry for the Interior (MVD) and the office of the prosecutor, like through all the bureaucracy of the government of the town of Moscow. </seg>

<seg id="20"> "It is about an ineffective system in which the criminal groups fills a vacuum in certain fields where the city does not provide certain services." </seg>

<p>
<seg id="21"> The report indicates that FSB brews the money of the more large companies and that the police target the small ones. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> A source, he said, "explained why the owners of company of Moscow understood that it was preferable to obtain the protection of the MVD and FSB (rather than of the groups of the organized crime) because, not only, they have more weapons, more means and to be able more that the criminal groups but they are also protected by the law. " </seg>
<seg id="23"> "This is why the request for protection by the criminal gangs is not also any more high." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The note announces that, although the collection of the money is wide, protection itself can be unequal\; even those which pay are sometimes subjected to an arrest. </seg>
<seg id="25"> Those which do not pay quickly see their business closing under a pretext or another. </seg>
</p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> According to Indem, the costs of corruption would rise, at the level of very whole Russia, with more than 300 billion dollars a year. </seg>
<seg id="33"> The country was classified 154e in a recent survey on the total perception of corruption by the Transparency International non-governmental organization (the countries are classified at least with most corrupted). </seg>

<seg id="10"> In front of this evolution of the situation, the anxiety increased near the veterans of the Khmer Rouges of Anlong Veng\; complicating the efforts of reconciliation and their wills to reintegrate itself in the Kampuchean company. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Bielorussia agrees to give up its uranium stock of military quality </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The government of Bielorussia announced Wednesday that it was going to give up its uranium stock highly enriched, an essential component for the nuclear weapons\; this décison lies within the scope of a surprised victory of the countryside of president Obama to make safe the nuclear matters in the whole world </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The agreement was revealed in a joint news release published after the Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton met the Belorusse Foreign Minister here, Sergei Martynov, in margin of a top on safety. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The US government had tried during years to convince Bielorussia to give up uranium highly enriched and seemed to have released the horizon last spring. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But the American officials declared in Washington Post that certain classified operations were carried out with Bielorussia during the last two months to eliminate 187 pounds from the military uranium of quality starting from a research center of Bielorussia. </seg>
<seg id="6"> That opened up the way for an agreement to Wednesday eliminate the remainder from the matter of approximately 500 pounds, according to a civil servant who evoked the condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the question. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> The agreement seems to be one of the most important results of the Summit of Nuclear safety of 47 nations, organized on the initiative of Obama\; where Bielorussia was excluded. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Apparently, it was advantageous to get an invitation with the Soviet ex-republic following the top, in 2012. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I am really fascinated by the fact that they want a seat at the Top of Nuclear safety of 2012 Sommet nuclear power of safety." </seg>
<seg id="10"> "That proves to me that this process functions," declared Ken Luongo, president of the Partnership for world safety, a group of promotion of nuclear safety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> Clinton qualified the agreement "of very significant, important stage" carried out by Bielorussia. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Obama committed himself in Prague in April 2009 making safe all the vulnerable nuclear matters throughout the world in the four years to come. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Since then, the US government helped six countries to get rid of all their uranium highly enriched. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Bielorussia would be the seventh. </seg>
<seg id="15"> A dozen countries did it under the administration of George W. Bush. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> At the time of the Summit on the nuclear safety of Obama, the Belorusse president, Alexandre Loukachenko, stated that the nation would never give up its uranium. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> "We kept uranium highly enriched, hundreds of kilograms of what is primarily of the military uranium of quality and slightly enriched uranium," Mr. Loukachenko said then. </seg>
<seg id="18"> "It is our product... Us will not manufacture dirty bombs, and we will sell it to nobody." </seg>
<seg id="19"> "We will use it at ends of research, it is all." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="20"> Bielorussia approached the United States a few months ago\; however, by expressing interest to manage an agreement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The first implementation to eliminate uranium from Bielorussia, in October, was particularly complicated because the material had been slightly irradiated, indicated persons in charge. </seg>
<seg id="22"> It was charged on a special train which traversed more than 1,300 miles to an installation in Russia to be stored and eliminated, indicated persons in charge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The second operation was completed Monday and was carried out by plane, according to the persons in charge. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The US government spent 13 million dollars in its efforts, mainly to replace the installations of research of Bielorussia with slightly enriched uranium\; misfit for the weapons. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> "A meticulous coordination and an organization were put in work in order to reinforce confidence"\; thus leading to the agreement signed by Clinton, declared Andrew Bieniawski, a person in charge of the department of energy specialized in the Reduction of the world Threat. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> According to the estimates of the Center of Study of Nonprolifération James Martin, Bielorussia had this year at least 88 pounds of military uranium of quality, as well as hundreds of kilos of uranium highly enriched. </seg>
<seg id="27"> Bielorussia seeks to eliminate its stocks by 2012, according to a joint statement. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> The relations between Bielorussia and the United States are tightened since years, mainly because of hard repression by Loukachenko of the Human rights. </seg>
<seg id="29"> But the declaration of Wednesday suggested a potential revival. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="30"> "All while being pleased with progress on these questions of security world, the United States and Bielorussia recognized that a respect increased for the democracy and the Human rights in Bielorussia remained essential to improve the bilateral relations\; and essential to the progress of the country and its citizens," she declared. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> That is shown by the documents filtered (cables) by Wikileaks with the daily newspaper El País, which add that the first vice-president of the Government of this time, María Teresa Fernández de la Vega, had asked that the Spanish Executive be informed for "pouvoir' to show that they exerted an adequate vigilance on the foreign planes which crossed Spain." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> In June of 2006, after a report of the Council of Europe which showed of complicity in contrary practices with the human rights with a dozen countries, among which Spain, took place a meeting between the former North-American ambassador Eduardo Aguirre and Fernández of Vega. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The vice-president recognized that the report of the Council "had surprised the Government of Zapatero off-side" and insisted on the fact that Spain had nothing there to hide. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "Of Vega stressed that Spain does not have an objection with regard to the flights of intelligence over Spanish territory." </seg>
<seg id="7"> "They want to only be informed" to prevent that one "takes them with deprived," Aguirre in a cable reports. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The holder of the Ministry of External of this time, Miguel Ángel Moratinos, announced to the ambassador that the Spanish Executive "wanted to give to this business profiles it low possible, even if, as it was with the hands of the judges, the Government had a capacity of limited influence." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In his turn, to January of 2007, the prosecutor Vicente González transmitted to the Embassy the fact that it was not going to block the initiative of the judge to ask the declassification of the documents of the National center of Intelligence (CNI) and of the ministry for Defense on the flights of the CIA. </seg>
<seg id="10"> "These reports contain any accusing element, no sensitive information," explained the Embassy after having spoken with the prosecutor. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The United States showed nevertheless their concern for "apparent coordination between the Spanish judge and the German prosecutors" more than for déclassifiée information of CNI O of the ministry for Defense. </seg>
<seg id="12"> "This coordination between the independent investigators will complicate our efforts to discreetly operate the case between the Governments," Aguirre regrets. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> In March of 2007 during a lunch between the ambassador of the United States and the minister of Interns, Alfredo Pérez Rubalcaba, this one commented to him that "even if the Spanish judges are madly jealous of its independence and will do what they consider adequate," it had given instructions to his collaborators "so that they avoid the comments of an ignited rhetoric, while trying to lower again the temperature." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The ambassador expresses also his concern for the action of PP in this business. </seg>
<seg id="15"> "In spite of its pro-American general orientation, our experiment suggests the fact that PP certainly will benefit from any indication according to which the Government of Zapatero tolerated or deliberately been unaware of the actions of the United States who could be interpreted like possible violations of the human rights, even if those revelations have negative consequences for the Government of the United States," she announces. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The owners of the center of Olot does not eliminate the possibility of that their male nurse of night killed more than 11 elderly people </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The persons in charge of geriatric Caritat d' Olot (Gérone) offered yesterday a press conference to underline the injuries caused at the institution by the criminal behavior of Joan Vila Dilmé, the male nurse who killed at least eleven elderly people for which it was responsible in the interval that it worked there. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The director of the residence, Joan Salted, presented himself accompanied by lawyer by the center, Joan Cañada and announced that "the desire of Caritat would be that to be able to exert the charge against the person in charge" for deaths but "legality and responsibility oblige us to assume the processual situation of civil persons in charge." </seg>
<seg id="5"> And except for social discreditation that the entity can suffer not to have detected in time the criminal activities of the male nurse of night, the great threat for Caritat now takes the shape of an important compensation that the legal representatives of the parents of the victims calculate already. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> Joan Vila Dilmé acknowledged that the first crime dates from August 2009 and that as from this day it did not cease killing. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The judge mentioned in the sentence which it ordered the exhumation of eight body - former patients of the geriatric one - care it suspected that in much case no doctor explored the deceased ones personally but, being given the age and pathologies of the patients, the formality took place by telephone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Caritat, through its director, categorically denied yesterday this situation and mentioned that "the lack of measurements can have been in no moment the cause what did without." </seg>
<seg id="9"> The lawyer of Caritat added that "in this business there is only one index of imprudence on behalf of any other person that is not the defendant." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The already baptized person as "the Angel of Death" acknowledged 11 assassinations day before yesterday and detailed that he committed the first crime on August 29th, 2009 and a month and half later he killed one second grandmother. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In this case it caused death to him by injecting an insulin sober-amount to him, with difference of the first crime which it had committed with one mix of pastilles sedatives. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The director of Caritat mentioned the fact that it is complicated to control the access of the staff of the center to medicines. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The insulin injections and the cocktail of sedatives had been the mechanism used into six of the nine crimes that the male nurse, in his desire to relieve the suffering of the interns, used to kill them. </seg>
<seg id="14"> But the analyses of laboratory will clarify if Villa does not lie by saying that he sought for his first victims a death less cruel or by opposite he burned them inside by giving them detergent as he already acknowledged that he made with the three women that he killed in the interval October 12th-17th. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Caritat does not believe the declarations of the male nurse of night, either the number of assassinations acknowledged, they do not eliminate the possibility of the number is larger and justify their attitude by the various versions that Vila gave in its visits to the County court and the lack of logic in the change in the manner of successfully killing after having made eight assassinations. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Red Bull triumphs in F1 with a secret weapon over Siemens </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> A software creates improvements on the cars at real time. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> As soon as Red Bull entered the world of Formula 1 in 2004, its history in this select universe speed was marked by the surprise and success. </seg>
<seg id="4"> In a first moment, nobody held in account the options of a new stable which had just arrived, in spite of the ascending trajectory of last the seasons, the past November, in the last phase of the championship they bet all on the triumph of Ferrari de Fernando Alonso. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Without lowering the skill as pilot of the champion, German Sebastien Vette, either the capacity of the Renault engine which propels its car, in the world of Formula 1 one speaks about the legend of the "weapon secrecy" that the multinational company Siemens put at the hands of Red Bull to transform it in a team winner. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> It is actually about a powerful software of simulation of process which the German company launched on the market in 2007 with objectives very far away from the automobilistic high-level competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Named PLM, this powerful data-processing instrument was used to create assembly lines of the factories producers of everyone, stations of energy, instruments of utmost precision. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The objective is to reproduce, accurately simulate the product or the process before building it in a real way, by thus avoiding the avoidable defects and costs. </seg>
<seg id="9"> PLM facilitated the development of the cameras of Canon, the planes of Sukhoi or most famous the commercial vehicles of Nissan. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> Siegfried Russwurm, person in charge of the industrial division of Siemens, explains the fact that the use of this data-processing instrument in its factory of Formula 1 allowed Red Bull to create and carry out "in a few hours, almost in real time," the modifications, changes and improvements detected during the races and tests. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Russwurm explains why the stables of the year 1992 had an average of 10 technicians in their teams which was able to introduce a maximum of three or four improvements on the vehicles each season. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In the team of Red Bull 180 young professionals of high qualification work today who, equipped with powerful computer equipment analyze and project any kind of modifications on the racing cars. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> The leader of Siemens explained that software PLM is able to analyze and improve all the elements of the racing cars of Red Bull except the engine, which is exclusive responsibility for Renault. </seg>
<seg id="14"> One modifies materials, fuel, the aerodynamics and the members safety. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The changes can pass from the virtual reality of the simulator to reality in less than 12 midnight, thanks to advanced systems of production by laser and autoclaves of high technology. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> As single limitation of this madness of the technological improvement there is the amount of 40 million dollars which each team of Formula 1 can spend like limit each season to facilitate competition. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Red Bull established the factory of high technology to create and produce its racing cars in a locality with 50 kilometers of London. </seg>
<seg id="18"> They are two buildings where the visits, especially for the journalists, are restricted. </seg>
<seg id="19"> All that occurs over there is considered "secret signal." </seg>
<seg id="20"> Staff for this duty counts to 580 people, Ci-included two pilots, the Vettel champion and Mark Webber. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The hero of Formula 1 of Red Bull, undoubtedly, is the recent champion Sebastian Vetell. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Between the immense technological resources that the energy drink mark has met with the service of its participation in the circuits, there are other hidden protagonists, whose activity is priceless and worthless notoriety. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="23"> The director of technology of the factory, Steve Nevey, affirms that five years ago one could affirm that progress of R+D in the case of racing racing cars brought the 50% of the victories and the pilots were responsible moreover. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Today these percentages changed and technology accounts for the 85% of success, while the pilots bring the 15% of the added-value. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Nevey acknowledges that Vettel or Webber will never be replaced by data processing, because "they are unforeseeable gladiators." </seg>

<seg id="1"> ECSC rejects the possibility of one second wave of fusions among the cases </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The chief executive officer of ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of a new wave of fusions of savings banks and insisted again on the speed with which the reorganization of the sector is carried out. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> When the lawsuit of concentration of the Spanish savings banks started, there were several entities which ensured that they were not going to take part in this first phase and that they were reserved for the second phase. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Nevertheless, the chief executive officer of the Spanish Confederation of Savings banks (ECSC), Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, rejected yesterday the possibility of the production of this new wave of operations. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> "I think that most of fusions was carried out, one cannot say that the incorporation of Cajasol in the group of Banca Cívica is one second phase, they are adjustments." </seg>
<seg id="6"> "The majority were carried out completion\; it is possible that instead of 17 one goes to 13 or 14, but all the great processes were carried out already under the supervision of the Bank of Spain, which collaborated much in this operation also," the leader underlined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In the declarations during a breakfast of the Association of the Leaders and Executives of Aragón (ADEA), Olavarrieta stated that the process of concentration is carried out "at more possible high speed and we must be very satisfied with the manner that it is carried out within the deadlines that one fixed in the past, not now, in the business plans with the Bank of Spain," he emphatisé. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> "The passage of 45 cases with an average of 28,500 million volume of the credits with 17 with 75,500 million is a lawsuit without equal in the history, by reducing the number of entities by 62% so that they are much larger to be in conformity with Basle," he underlined. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Olavarrieta recognized that "there are a series of opinions rather not very happy on the slowness of the process" which shows "a lack of serosity and direction," because "what the Bank of Spain made is to recall that one must respect the time before the end of the year." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The chief executive officer of ECSC, Jose Antonio Olavarrieta, ensured yesterday that Spain has the most rigorous financial system of any Europe and "probably" of the world and it allotted to the people who question it a "lack of knowledge." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The leader mentioned that being given the current economic conjuncture, "we can remain very quiet" with the situation of the financial entities and of the savings banks, a system which began a "very important" process of concentration and "goes at the possible larger speed." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> He also recalled that the Spanish banking environment of it is quite drawn from the tests of stress that ECB realized in July. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Zapatero and the German red line </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Berlin chose to remain in the euro, but it has establishes the conditions for all the Union. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The tensions of the markets caused a doble governmental answer. </seg>
<seg id="4"> On a side, José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero announced new methods of adjustment, which vary tax reductions for PMEs, regulation of the private agencies of placement or suppression of the 426 euros assistance to the unemployed without professional contribution to the privatisation of the 49% of AENA, the management of the airports of Barajas and El Prat and of the 30% of the Lotteries of the State. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Of another, the Elena Salgado vice-president, with the support of former president Felipe González, links herself with criticisms of the chancellor Angela Merkel with regard to her responsibility to detach the current crisis. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> How these should movements be interpreted? </seg>
<seg id="7"> It should be mentioned that the position of Merkel is not an error in its communicative policy. </seg>
<seg id="8"> On the contrary, it is another restriction of the difficult process of redefinition of the euro. </seg>
<seg id="9"> And there Germany has a radically new vision of what must be its future, which shocks with that to maintain the old traditions of the majority of its partners. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Vis-a-vis European resistances, in Germany one starts to speculate in the three possible exits of the crisis. </seg>
<seg id="11"> The first, one euro strong, integrated by itself, Austria and Holland, inter alia country, and the south would give up the monetary area. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The second, the recovery of the Mark, even if maintaining that seems science fiction, with a very favorable trend of public opinion, close to one 50% of the population. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The third, a new design of the euro, on line with the German proposals for a greater macro-economic control, strict budgetary policy, fines with the countries which transgress them, of possible suspensions of payment of one of them and extension to the private sector of the costs of the potential adjustments. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="14"> The German position is clear and that made a long time that it is defined, consequently now it does not have there room for excuses. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Initially, in 2009, when such an amount of the IMF as the European Commission stimulated the deficits, the German Government invented a constitutional reform to prevent them starting from 2016. </seg>
<seg id="16"> That was the first signal of divergence between what Germany thought that one was to make (plane tax rigor and stability of public finances) and what its European partners, Ci-includes France, practiced. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The second blow of the country center-European was when Merkel prolonged the decision with difficulty to save Greece. </seg>
<seg id="18"> As of this moment it was the object of a wild criticism, but the truth is that the political consensus in Germany and the public opinion and published were against the rescue of Greece. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Finally, around the end of October, Merkel expresses a clear position again, while asking reforms it treaties of the Union to make possible the rescue of a country and to oblige at the same time with the private lenders to support a share of the cost. </seg>
<seg id="20"> This position was interpreted like anti-European, because it precipitated the Irish crisis and the remainder. </seg>
<seg id="21"> But its proposal, although a little edulcorated, was approved and, the months following, should attend to us the reform process of the Union which makes possible these mesures starting from 2013. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="22"> Germany traced a red line which she does not think of crossing. </seg>
<seg id="23"> And she tells us with all that, even if now one must take measures with which one is perhaps not too much agreement, starting from this date there the old operation of the euro would have finished. </seg>
<seg id="24"> 2013 will mean the birth of new monetary area, in which the countries which transgress the rules will severely be sanctioned, they can be obliged with declared in suspension of payment and, in this case, the private sector will support also a party of the costs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="25"> Germany announces us that we must follow a severe way of growth with high rates of savings and investment, moderation in consumption, of the improvements in the productivity and competitiveness and of trade balances positive. </seg>
<seg id="26"> An alternative based on the debt and construction, with enormous holes in the balance of payments, as that which chaired the Spanish growth in the years of the boom, will simply not be tolerated. </seg>
<seg id="27"> The setting is clear. </seg>
<seg id="28"> And it would be badly not to hear it. </seg>
<seg id="29"> It is not only a question of renewing the public deficit to the 3% in 2013. </seg>
<seg id="30"> What one us request is much harder. </seg>
<seg id="31"> And what it should not absolutely do in these circumstances is to mislead us ourselves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="32"> I hope that current turbulences let arrive towards us a larger peace. </seg>
<seg id="33"> And that one can seize opportunity that one gave us, until the spring of 2013. </seg>
<seg id="34"> It seems that president Zapatero also heard it this form and its double declaration (reform them Saturday promised after the meeting of the past with the large companies and the announcement of yesterday of new measurements) suggests that, in spite of criticisms of Merkel, one opened the way with the thesis which it is necessary to put of the order for the house. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> But the red line that Germany traced is there, and they do not seem to move it. </seg>
<seg id="36"> And among the possibilities that one considers, one cannot exclude that to give up a monetary area too much faggot of not very serious country. </seg>
<seg id="37"> And in this case, Germany us will be able to always say that she had informed us. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The characteristic of the Pakistani nuclear program - the fact that the weapons are not assembled, but they are stored by components to make difficult their destruction in the event of attack - is one of the main reasons of concern in Washington. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Thus the ambassador in Pakistan, Anne W. Patterson, enumerates in a report before the visit of the former adviser of National security, James Jones: "Proximity of certain nuclear installations of the territory under attack Taliban, the dispersion of the nuclear materials whose noise runs and vulnerability of the transport of atomic materials." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The a large number of people implied in the nuclear arsenals and the programs of missiles is considered, not only by the United States, but also by Russia, like proliferating and a reason to maintain the guard. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The new one of the documentation filtered by the gate of Julian Assange is the co-operation each time more reduced between the United States and Pakistan in the field of nuclear proliferation and the high Pakistani degree of production of armed nuclear. </seg>
<seg id="11"> A dispatch of the Embassy in May, which qualifies like "frustrating" the communication with Pakistan, supports what follows: "The transparency is frequently non-existent\; the offers of assistance remain unanswered or are eliminated." </seg>
<seg id="12"> In another message, Peter Lavoy, civil servant of the National Intelligence for the south of Asia, note that "in spite of the economic catastrophe, produced Pakistan of the nuclear weapons at intervals faster than any other country of the world." </seg>

<seg id="4"> All the related aspects with Wikileaks and its founder, Julian Assange, forms a complicated labyrinth where it is difficult to have a certainty on the facts. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday Interpol emitted a "Red Alert" "to locate and follow the movements" of Assange. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Nevertheless, it is not about a traditional order of arrest. </seg>
<seg id="7"> Moreover, this one is not new, if not it date of November 20th. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The 20 body international police officer having the seat in Lyon (France) dictated the order with request for Sweden, but it did not do it public until yesterday, after having received the authorization of the authorities of this country. </seg>
<seg id="11"> Thus, the 188 countries of Interpol received the indication to identify or locate Assange "to obtain its provisional arrest and its extradition." </seg>

<seg id="4"> Joan Puigcercós seems to have found the receipt to solve the umpteenth internal revolt inside ERC, without north because of the loss of 11 deputies and half of the votes. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The president of the party is conscious owing to the fact that its threat of resignation is not sufficient for the followers of the former leader Josep Lluís Carod-Rovira, but at the same time it knows that the influence of this sector is now as diluted as its liar and than that cannot absolutely give him headaches which it had with other extinct currents. </seg>
<seg id="6"> Therefore the leader of Esquerra will try to gain his new critics with winks which enable him to be armoured until the local elections. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> To start, Puigcercós announced yesterday that more than 200 national advisers of ERC will be able to come to a conclusion about its continuity in secrecy. </seg>
<seg id="8"> By paper ballots, not while raising the hand. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If the carodists want to convey a certain vote of penalization to the president, they will be able to do it without any fear with the reprisals. </seg>
<seg id="10"> In fact, the chief of rows wants to avoid the image of division and that of tender to his person. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In several interviews he affirmed that he would not be considered not ratified with half plus one of the votes, but he added, without mentioning the percentages, that a result "with Bulgarian" would not be good either. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The close people with Carod require with the president a little more than to place his position at the disposal of the militance, a gesture that not be worth when Puigcercós controls the body maxim between the congresses. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But because they do not have a sufficient majority to force resignations, they will try to approve with the executive a roadmap until May. </seg>
<seg id="14"> For that, they hope to take part in the development of the strategic document of reorientation that the direction will subject to the voting of the national council the 18. </seg>
<seg id="15"> Its intention is to support Puigcercós in return for the promise of this one to program the congress for the autumn of 2011, which the leaders regard as a sure fact. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> The leader of ERC acknowledged that the "polyphony" affects the stability and that its objective is to make that once and for all the organization is able to wash its linen room in family. </seg>

<seg id="19"> And it enumerated five of them, of which it underlines two. </seg>
<seg id="20"> The first, "to recompose" the executive so that it accounts for at least 90% of the militance, i.e., to include new figures which come from the sector follower of Carod. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> The second can be the character of great news. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Huguet proposes that liquid ERC of once and for all the assembly like mechanism of operation. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Thus, it defends one reforms statutes which allows the realization of the congresses through delegates elected by vote. </seg>
<seg id="24"> To finish with the model of assembly, an exception in the system of Spanish parties, was an obsession of the team of Puigcercós, which fought already in this direction in the last two congresses. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The second stage of the Pleasures of the language was a walk in which the participants made display of the narration </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> "Do the sex in the language, I understand it, but... the finger on the wound? what am ego hoped for? ," asked the writer invited Luisa Valenzuela has to open the second stage of the Pleasures of the language, a cycle which celebrates the Spanish literature and who this time used the subtitle of his question (during another fair the round table was dedicated to the Sex in the language, explained it). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The finger on the wound..." puts to us in the embarrassment," launched gently the Argentina writer to the public, most young people, who had met in the International exhibition of the Book of Guadalajara (WIRE) to listen to this table moderated by Marisol Shultz and in which took part Valenzuela, Sergio Ramírez, Mayra Montero and Luis García Montero. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Luisa Valenzuela read a text dedicated to Gonzalo Celorio that Shultz defined afterwards as a great history, with Luisa in first nobody as a protagonist who seeks knowledge which is the "wound," it goes from a doctor to another, without obtaining an answer, only tracks in the same narrative wire. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The infectiologist it leaves convinced: "patience is not my fort, it is perhaps my wound." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> At the end, after one frustrated approach with the traumatologist who cut the breath in the middle of the corridor to him, but which explains to him why wound is not a scientific term\; it is the psychoanalyst whom the mystery reveals: "the wound is what is actually open, the symbolic system is the scar." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The protagonist sighed relieved and concludes: "on the wound I only could know that it which is actually open and which it does not exist," but is convinced owing to the fact that the pleasures and the traps of the language must be very dependant between them. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Valenzuela, the writer, played with both. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The Nicaraguan Sergio Ramírez as exposed a charming narration as it entitled Éloge with the invention, where the finger on the wound is not numbered but at a given time is discovered. </seg>
<seg id="11"> With keys of magic realism, he speaks about a famous enchantress who touched clouds, made turn over people which had been gone far or repaired virtues that a damsel had lost, a narration which America transfers to speak then, the great news which had as of the beginning its own chroniclers and quoted in Bernal Díaz del Castillo who criticizes excesses of the narrations of the capitans conquerors. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> "Cervantes which invented us all (writers) is made fun of the false witnesses which appeared in the stories presented like real, but of a aitre manner one would never have told the history of America with an imagination which missed even decency." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> Nevertheless, it, "they underlined insane and the liars have best imagination" and here reality converges with the lie, one does not know any more which share of the narration belongs to a band or another, where the literature of fiction reaches its apogee. </seg>
<seg id="14"> One calls that in fact the "tradition of Cervantes." </seg>
<seg id="15"> "It is thanks to its heritage which one is what one tells." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="16"> In his turn, the writer Mayra Montyero annotated and applauded the variety of interpretations caused by the invitation of the WIRE with its round table owes It on the wound. </seg>
<seg id="17"> The Cubanone has met it his on the large wound of social violence that its country crosses - and the Latin America divides - produced arguments of adulterates and the sale of drugs. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> "I think that the good literature, good poetry the good songs contain a tacit commitment that is not of course premeditated," indicated it, after quoting that the reality of the literature is the communication and the dimension of the commitment which is established between the author and the readers, and who it is a "chemical reaction" of the latter. </seg>
</p>
<p>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> "To be the Masters of our own feelings and to be the Masters of reality, we must moderate: and to moderate means much time to pose the finger on the wound and to disturb the people who feel very convenient while thinking in caricature, white and black, established ideas and without nuance and to also disturb with the powers which prefer a world in white and black," has he says, while inviting to recover the direction to write. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales it had tops and bottoms in its career, but it knew to reach three times the decisive series. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> With the duel of Santos Laguna and Monterrey in the final, there is in more two different styles which are confronted, marked by their technicians, who find between them a contrast marked by the results. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> Rubén Omar Romano had three defeats in finales, it had tops and bottoms in its career, but it knew to reach three times the decisive series, even if until now it did not put in the thousand and therefore this occasion is very special for him. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The Argentinian one ended up being comforted with the medal of under-champion, there remained a step behind the winners and curiously with the same team he played of the consecutive finales. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The strategist santist arrived at his first final as a trainer in the Tournament of Opening 2002, when it held the reins of Morelia with which it lost with a total result of 4-2 against Toluca\; later on, in the Fence 2003 it arrived also at the decisive duel and again lost with the total result of 3-1 and that was precisely against Rayados. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> With Santos Laguna already, in the Tournament Bicentenary 2010, again against Diablos, Rubén a reverse suffered again, because its team made a match equal of 2-2 against Choriceros after 210 minutes of play, but in the series of penalties it obtained an advantage for 3-1 with two opportunities to obtain the title and finally three of its players missed by 11 meters and it suffered the jump with the result from 4-3. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Rubén lost two finales with Diablos Rojos and one with Monterrey, its rival with the tournament, consequently it does not want to have the same fate, it tries to be detached from the evil spell to be able to celebrate for the first time a title, even if it affirms that for him the institution is more important. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> "I want to be champion, I do not want to break any statistics, that is for a club, not for a passion which I have and consequently I will obtain the title, but what I mentioned before is more important," the quartermaster commented on when one asked him who would be its weak points in the finales. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> He remembers much the last finale, of which he ensures that he learned much, "the single lesson that we can retain it is that until the referee does not whistle the final one, we cannot celebrate, we are prepared in the line, the players also, because the last time, with two penalties to draw we were already prepared to run and I believe that is a lesson, before the end of the match one cannot celebrate." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> It knows that this series could be defined by penalties, which does not worry it, because it entrusts in its players: "One never seeks to arrive at the series of penalties, one tries to finish within the regular time, but sometimes it remains us only to prepare us, the former tournament we were prepared, unfortunately the destiny made us a nasty trick, sometimes they are the emotions or distresses to hold the title between our hands, hands it has escaped us, that was useful to us like lesson for this final and we hope that one does not arrive any more in this situation." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Romano now has the opportunity more of not being a one technician under-champion and of tasting for the first time the glory offered by the titles. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="2"> The radio presenter of Quebec Stephan Dupont underwent a reverse partial in front of the Canadian Council of the standards of the radiotelevision (CCNR) for controversial statements on the social assistance and the Haitians just as on his coarse language in waves. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The CCNR judges that Mr. Dupont and his team of CHOI 98.1 FM had the right to express their opinions, but that certain remarks contained of "inaccurate information on the social assistance, of the unduly negative representations of the Haitians and the coarse language which is not appropriate for the emissions diffused during the day." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The Council also concluded that a discussion on the suicide, including the diffusion of the name of two people who had committed suicide, did not infringe the codes on broadcasting. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> The CCNR had received several complaints about comments made during emissions diffused between 2008 and 2010. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> The first decision was rendered following a complaint of the Common front of the social assisted people of Quebec. </seg>
<seg id="7"> The group complained that the amounts quoted in the emission were inaccurate. </seg>
<seg id="8"> The presenters must rather present solid information than misleading. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Concerning the suicide, the presenter Stephan Dupont had estimated that the suicide is a gesture of coward. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The majority of the members of the Committee concluded that the conveyed message was that the suicide should not be seen as a solution with the problems of the life. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "The majority of the Committee considers that the episodes blamed of "Dupont midday" broached a delicate subject in a way equitable and adapted." </seg>
<seg id="12"> No blame was thus retained at its place. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The last litigation related to declarations which followed the earthquake to Haiti. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> The presenter of CHOI declared that it had not made any donation to help the Haitians because one could not know with certainty that people needy would receive really the money. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> "I already purged my three day old suspension on top." </seg>

<seg id="6"> Two thirds of them indeed say not to believe the environmental commitment of the companies just like the green publicity of the companies, reveals the measuring instrument worked out by the Observatory of consumption responsible for the Sherbrooke University. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Another report: half of the consumers doubts the reliability of the official certifications affixed on the products known as equitable, but also of the credibility of the products and the marks posting itself as being écoresponsables, the Barometer indicates. </seg>
<seg id="8"> In the same vein, the speech of the politicians on this topic is taken with serious by only 14.6% of the Inhabitants of Quebec. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> Information as regards responsible consumption seems however paramount to stimulate this side of consumption currently animated by nearly one the third of the Québécois consumers. </seg>
<seg id="10"> Indeed, the vacuum and the doubtful character of information would calm the heats of 46% of the consumers. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is the second brake identified by the Barometer, after the higher price of these products. </seg>
<seg id="12"> In addition, a third of the Inhabitants of Quebec is also said being wary towards the pled performances of the products or green services which one seeks to put to them between the hands. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> The Company of Angus development and the Parallel, which hoped for a gift of seven million dollars of the ministry for the Culture to repurchase in Daniel Langlois the cinematographic complex eXcentris on the St. Lawrence boulevard by giving again its full cinephilic vocation to him, do not obtain what they claimed. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The government agrees to be implied in the file, but in its own conditions. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> Rather than the expected gift, the government of Quebec proposes a loan whose amount would be lower than initial waitings besides, which could constitute a viable solution under advantageous conditions, at least of the opinion of the sources resulting from the dispensaries of the State. </seg>
<seg id="6"> A first action plan and a request for 12.8 million already had been rejected by Quebec last spring, but the requests for summer have re-examined downwards. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> A proposal and an action plan were sent to the minister St-Pierre by the president of the Company of development of the cultural companies (SODEC), François Macerola, who controls the file of eXcentris. </seg>
<seg id="8"> It forwarded to him an ultimate report about ten days ago. </seg>
<seg id="9"> But the counter-proposal of the cabinet arrived at the SODEC Tuesday. </seg>
<seg id="10"> The Parallel and Angus have to answer it until December 31st. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It seems however that the assumption of the gift of the State must really be isolated. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> Let us recall that the Association of the owners of cinemas and cinéparcs of Quebec was opposed to a direct investment of the State to support the repurchase of eXcentris, asserting that the ministry for the Culture does not have to finance real estate projects, which it did not do for other cinemas. </seg>
<seg id="13"> But several speakers of the medium claimed on the contrary a substantial economic aid. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Daniel Langlois, master of the house, during ten years carried at arm's length the cinema of author in his buildings of the complex after having financed itself his construction, which could justify an exemption on behalf of the Council of the treasure. </seg>

<p>
<seg id="17"> Since spring 2009, only one of the three screens, the Parallel, continues to diffuse films with eXcentris. </seg>
<seg id="18"> The goal of the future purchasers is to reopen the three rooms on February 27th by showing very beautiful film of Xavier Beauvois Of the men and the gods. </seg>

</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The new American diplomatic cables revealed by WikiLeaks raise the veil on what the United States regards as the complex of inferiority of the Canadians towards the Americans, but they betray at the same time the feeling of superiority of the latter towards Canada. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Thus, the American diplomats are astonished that each Canadian voter does not have the canado-American relations with the spirit while going to vote and believe that the visit of president Obama helped the conservative government to make adopt its budget in 2009! </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The four new communications between the American embassy in Ottawa and Washington, spread out over the public place yesterday, offer more crusty details that substantial contents to put itself under the tooth. </seg>
<seg id="5"> A cable dated September 22nd, 2008, is in full federal electoral campaign, reports at which point the United States is not part of the challenges discussed by the political leaders. </seg>
<seg id="6"> With the great astonishment of the American ambassador in station with Ottawa, David Wilkins. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Mr. Wilkins offers some explanations to this situation. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Perhaps "an almost inherent complex of inferiority Canadian conditions the Canadian political leaders with speaking about interior challenges of the daily newspaper rather than to make carry this election on the United States (as at the time of the countryside on the free trade of 1988) ," he writes. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The United States is thus, he concludes, "the proverbial elephant of this election: omnipresent, but potentially too threatening to speak about it." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> The ambassador understands of as much less this "deafening silence" that the two countries have an intense political relation and economic. </seg>
<seg id="11"> "Logically, he estimates, the capacity of a candidate, a party and even more than one head of party to manage this essential relation should be a key factor which the voters have with the spirit while going to vote." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="12"> The other expression of this feeling of importance is read in the cable sent on January 22nd, 2009 by Terry Breese, person in charge in Ottawa, preparing president Barack Obama with his first visit in Ottawa. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Your voyage will help to ensure the survival of the government at the time of the vote of confidence at the beginning of February on the federal budget, by which Canada will post its first deficit besides one decade because of a revival program from 30 to 40 billion dollars," writing Mr. Breese. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Nowhere it is not made mention that the government had to extend the Parliament before Christmas to prevent being reversed by the coalition and that the opposition parties made its survival conditional to the quality of the revival program suggested. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Another communication, gone back to January 2008 and signed of the ambassador Wilkins, warns Washington of the increasingly negative image that the diffused drama series with CBC return from the United States. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The ambassador worries about the emissions Border, Little Mosque one the Prairie, Intelligence and H2O, in which one observes not very subtle references to Maher Arar, "No-Fly-List" or to removals for muscular interrogations of the CIA. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> Another cable reports that, at the time of their first bilateral meeting, Hillary Clinton asked her French counterpart Bernard Kouchner if Europe were ready to accommodate certain prisoners of Guantánamo. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Mr. Kouchner answered yes, but on the basis of "individually." </seg>
<seg id="19"> At the end of the meeting, he is written, "it gave a paper to the Secretary of State in connection with Omar Khadr, a 15 year old Muslim of Canadian origin." </seg>
<seg id="20"> "The secretary agreed to re-examine the file." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> Let us note finally that the spirits warm up concerning the WikiLeaks site. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Tom Flanagan, a former adviser very close to Stephen Harper, declared on the waves of CBC that the person in charge of this massive escape should be "assassinated." </seg>

<seg id="1"> A world plan to renovate lighting </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> UNO proposed yesterday in Cancún a plan of restoration of domestic, commercial and industrial lighting in 100 countries in order to obtain a greenhouse gas reduction (GES) which to the third of the additional reduction that corresponds almost should be carried out to stabilize the planetary climate by 2020. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="3"> This ambitious plan is in the tread of the concrete great projects that UNO hopes to make adopt in Cancún to compensate for the absence of constraining commitments of reduction by the industrialized countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> According to the plan deposited yesterday, if the incandescent bulbs which still monopolize from 50 to 70% of the market were replaced by bulbs fluocompactes or, better, by bulbs with light-emitting diodes (LED or "English LED"), the main part of the 1.8 billion tons (WP) GES emitted on planet to light the human ones would be avoided. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Lighting is responsible for 8% of the world emissions. </seg>
<seg id="6"> It is the equivalent of 70% of the emissions of the planetary car fleet. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> In Copenhagen, last year, large transmitting countries, like the United States, China, Europe and others, of which Canada, engaged in voluntary reduction plans which should make pass the total emissions of GES of 53 WP with 49 WP. </seg>
<seg id="8"> But it will be necessary to withdraw of this assessment still 5 WP to manage to stabilize by 2020 the rise of the climate to 2 centigrade degrees in order to prevent that it does not become out of control. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> In the incandescent bulbs, 95% of energy are dissipated in the form of heat and the remainder, that is to say 5%, produced light. </seg>
<seg id="10"> With bulbs fluocompactes, the energy expense is reduced of 75% and with the new bulbs with LED, one reduces this energy requirement of twice still. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> The bulbs fluocompactes last on average from 6000 to 10,000 hours. </seg>
<seg id="12"> The new bulbs with LED, as those that launched the Philips manufacturer this week - this company took part besides under investigation of UNO -, have a 25,000 hours life expectancy and consume 80% less energy than an incandescent bulb, which gives an idea of the possible economy with a plan of replacement which would apply to 100 countries. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> These very new bulbs can also function with rheostats besides emitting very little heat. </seg>
<seg id="14"> And they do not contain any mercury. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Several specialists have posted reserves towards bulbs fluocompactes since they contain mercury and that they should be eliminated like dangerous wastes, which is not always possible in the developing countries, except if the manufacturers set up instructions. </seg>
<seg id="16"> But, indicates the report, the main source of mercury emission on planet is not the bulb fluocompacte, but rather the thermo plants with coal, which emit much mercury to produce electricity wasted in incandescent bulbs. </seg>
<seg id="17"> In the United States only, these power stations emit 25,000 tons of mercury per year. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> The report details the profits which each country thanks to this international program would make. </seg>
<seg id="19"> For example, Indonesia would thus save a billion dollar a year in purchases of electricity and eight million tons of CO2, is the equivalent of 3.5 thermo plants of which construction would cost him 2.5 billion. </seg>

<seg id="9"> Pascal Affi Guessan, campaign director of the president of the Ivory Coast, affirmed that the devices of intimidation of the voters practised by the FN in the north of the country had dissuaded the partisans from the outgoing president to go to vote. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> All the election could be cancelled if the lodged complaints by Gbagbo are retained by the Constitutional council. </seg>
<seg id="11"> However the adversaries of Gbagbo estimate that the high court of the country is not neutral because it is directed by Paul Yao DRE, a political allied close relation of Gbagbo. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Alassane Ouattara, man of the North which contradicts any bond with the ex-rebels, considered to be "unacceptable" the delay in the announcement of the results and requested from Gbagbo to respect them, but it did not go until asserting the victory. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Its allies affirm that Gbagbo blocks the publication of the results because it knows that it lost and that to carry felt sorry for before the Constitutional council, after having prevented the electoral commission from distributing the results, would be illegal. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Business Clotilde Reiss: the Elysium exaggerated the mediation of Syria </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> During more than ten months, from July 2009 to May 2010, fate of Clotilde Reiss, the French enquiring young person decree in Iran for "espionage," held the opinion in breath in France, put the diplomacy in alarm, and accentuated the deterioration of the relations between Paris and Teheran. </seg>
<seg id="3"> The whole under the attentive glance of the diplomats of the United States. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="4"> The American documents obtained by WikiLeaks and consulted by Le Monde reveal certain lower parts of this crisis. </seg>
<seg id="5"> They describe how the Elysium explained its strategy with the Americans, going until their giving councils for the treatment of their own crises of "hostages" in Iran (a small group of hikers). </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="6"> They show how the French officials sought to convince Washington that the release of the young Frenchwoman had not had as a counterpart the handing-over in freedom of Majid Kakavand, an Iranian held in France and sought by American justice for material traffic for the benefit of Iranian nuclear program. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="7"> Lastly, they place under a raw light the way in which the French presidency sought to handle the media to accredit the idea that the Syrian president, Bachar Al-Assad, had played a central role in the release of Clotilde Reiss. </seg>
<seg id="8"> Actually, it of it was nothing. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="9"> A diplomatic telegram written on August 12th, 2009 in Paris east entitled "Iran: French comments on the way of managing cases of hostages." </seg>
<seg id="10"> The adviser of the Elysium for the strategic business, François Richier, accompanied by the director of the French Foreign Office for Middle East and North Africa, Patrice Paoli, discuss with the American diplomat Kathleen Allegrone. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="11"> They explain the French method to him. </seg>
<seg id="12"> They advise with the Americans to make some as much to repatriate their own nationals selected of force in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="13"> "Made noise," they say, "unceasingly hammer" in the media the words "fundamental human rights," "innocence," "immediate liberation." </seg>
<seg id="14"> It is necessary it in order to embarrass the Iranian mode, sensitive to its image. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> "Do it more especially as the Iranians ask you not to do it." </seg>
<seg id="16"> Because, last the attempts at discussions by discrete channels, "silence will not regulate anything," the Iranians are "Masters in delaying tacticses." </seg>
<seg id="17"> Mr. Richier adds that the arrest from abroad is "a familiar Iranian tactic: the taking of hostages for the political blackmail." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="18"> He announces that the release of prison of Clotilde Reiss (who will intervene on August 16th, day when she takes refuge with the embassy of France) "will require the payment with the Iranians of a broad amount of money" (230 000 euros of guarantee). </seg>
<seg id="19"> And it states that the Elysium anticipates other crises of hostages, a phenomenon which "will worsen." </seg>
<seg id="20"> The Iranians could "in the near future stop another of some 1,800 French citizens alive in Iran," he says. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> August 28th, 2009. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Clotilde Reiss has been coming out of prison for twelve days, but remains blocked in Iran. </seg>
<seg id="23"> An information is disseminated: the Iranian Majid Kakavand, whose United States claims the extradition for an illegal traffic of sensitive electronic material towards Iran, is given in freedom to Paris, on decision of a judge. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="24"> The American embassy, like many observers, wonders about this disconcerting coincidence. </seg>
<seg id="25"> For Washington, which tracks the Iranian clandestine networks of acquisition of material intended for the nuclear program, the widening of Majid Khakavand is a bad news. </seg>
<seg id="26"> Did France accept a bargaining? </seg>
<seg id="27"> Release of the Iranian against that of the Frenchwoman? </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="28"> During a new discussion with Kathleen Allegrone, on September 4th, François Richier ensures that it is not the case. </seg>
<seg id="29"> The Elysium, he says, not only "was completely taken by surprised by the decision of the judge," but sought to be opposed to it. </seg>
<seg id="30"> "There were sharp exchanges between the French presidency and keeps it at the time seals" (, Michèle Alliot-Marie), but "the French government cannot reconsider the legal decision," he observes. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="31"> Mr. Richier wants to as show as Majid Kakavand remains placed under "narrow" the monitoring of the French intelligence services. </seg>
<seg id="32"> The adviser of the Elysium composes a phone number, hangs up again, then informs the American diplomat that the Iranian "is currently localised in buildings in Paris managed by the Iranian embassy." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="33"> During the detention of Clotilde Reiss in Iran, the Elysium does not spare its efforts, by means of official statements and of "escapes" organized in the media, to make believe that Syrian president Bachar Al-Assad plays important" and "influential" part an "of "mediator." </seg>
<seg id="34"> The Americans observe this activity not without irony, and note that handling bears fruit since several press articles reflect the French official version. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="35"> A telegram dated August 25th, 2009 evokes ""media blitz the" of official French." </seg>
<seg id="36"> On what such an amount of "gratitude" expressed towards Mr. Assad is based, wonders the embassy Paris. </seg>
<seg id="37"> "In spite of their declarations full with praises, official French recognizes into private that they have only one vague concept of what the Syrians really made." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="38"> The document leans then on the reasons which pushed the Elysium to be poured in this fiction. </seg>
<seg id="39"> The intense effort of communication "aims at validating the policy of Sarkozy of opening in Syria," he analyzes. </seg>
<seg id="40"> A policy launched in 2008, which "had then been perceived, by many critical voices in France and abroad, like premature and unmerited." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> In "exaggerating the Syrian role," Paris seeks "to show in Syria which praises it can attract itself by playing a constructive part in the area." </seg>
<seg id="42"> The objective is also "to sow seeds of discord between Syria and Iran." </seg>
<seg id="43"> The American embassy knows it good source. </seg>
<seg id="44"> On August 11th, François Richier entrusted to him: "of course, we do not know if the Syrians did anything." </seg>
<seg id="45"> "But thanked we them nevertheless." </seg>
<seg id="46"> "That should at least sow confusion among Iranians." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="47"> Clotilde Reiss returns to France on May 16th, 2010. </seg>
<seg id="48"> Nicolas Sarkozy receives it in the Elysium. </seg>
<seg id="49"> In an official statement, he thanks the presidents for Brazil, of Senegal, and Syria, for their "active role in favor of the release of our compatriot." </seg>

<seg id="10"> In a direction as in the other. </seg>
<seg id="11"> In 2006, even without believing in it, the friends of Jacques Chirac claimed that a third mandate was not excluded. </seg>

</p>
<p>
<seg id="13"> That it evokes in front of UMP members of Parliament, Tuesday evening in the Elysium, the prospect for "two mandates" thus sowed a little febrility. </seg>

<seg id="1"> Euro: the ECB forced to maintain its purchases of titles of State </seg>
</hl>
<p>
<seg id="2"> The last meeting of the Council of the governors of the European Central bank (BCE) of the year was to be the occasion to specify the methods of way out of crisis or, at least, to announce the stop of a good number of the nonconventional operations of monetary policy which must be completed at the end of the year. </seg>
<seg id="3"> Crisis of the European sovereign debt obliges, the issuing house of Frankfurt will not be able undoubtedly to be allowed to be as peremptory under penalty of worsening a situation as tended more today on the European bond markets. </seg>
<seg id="4"> The political cost would be all the more high. </seg>
<seg id="5"> Yesterday, at the time of a press conference, the Minister of Finance Frenchwoman, Christine Lagarde, thus greeted the active role played by the ECB in favor of the resolution of the crisis of the national debts in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="6"> She did not wish to say if she estimated that the central bank was to make more, by increasing for example her programme of purchase of sovereign obligations. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "I reserve my reflection with my European partners (...) ." </seg>
<seg id="8"> The day before, in Brussels, during its hearing by the commission of the Economic affairs and monetary of the European Parliament, the president of the ECB, Jean-Claude Trichet, was not shown more eloquent as for its intentions, being satisfied to indicate that the programme of purchase of titles of State on the resale market "continued" and that "we will see what we will decide" during the meeting of this Thursday. </seg>
<seg id="9"> Only certainty: the ECB will keep its unchanged directing principal rate with 1%, its low historical level since May 2009. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="10"> In the facts, the purchases of Treasury bonds by the ECB doubled last week, with nearly 1.35 billion euros. </seg>
<seg id="11"> And, according to the indiscretions of operators of market, it would have carried out new purchases of Irish and Portuguese titles, yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="12"> On the whole, the central banks of the eurosystème bought for 67 billion euros since May 2010. </seg>
<seg id="13"> Among the operators of market, anticipations of a continuation of the purchases are not any doubt (see page 29). </seg>
<seg id="14"> The economists either do not expect notable change of course. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> If the lending operations to more than three months already disappeared from the arsenal from the ECB, the latter still carries out unlimited allowances of liquidities according to generous conditions and for durations being spread out one week in three months. </seg>
<seg id="16"> The economists expect today that this device is prolonged of a few months. </seg>
<seg id="17"> "I cannot think that it modifies in an important way its program." </seg>
<seg id="18"> "If not it would be to take the chance to cause new short-term tensions," Michael Schubert, economist of Commerzbank estimates. </seg>
<seg id="19"> "A progressive exit announced during the first quarter 2011 appears more probable," anticipates on its side Norbert Bräms, economist at Sal. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Oppenheim. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> As regards its interventions on the market of the national debt, "the ECB should maintain a volume purchase of these obligations to animate a dull market," Norbert Bräms adds. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Taking into account the importance of the exposures of the European banks to the markets of sovereign debts of the euro zone, the issuing house does not have other choices only to maintain its presence on the market. </seg>
<seg id="23"> "It is necessary for him at all costs to replace the lack of investors on the market and to act of such kind to prevent a racing of the outputs paid by the most fragile States," an important bond manager testified yesterday. </seg>
<seg id="24"> Because if interest rates fly away, the States will be all the more constrained to reduce their debt, if not to stabilize it. </seg>

<seg id="2"> Christine Lagarde still hammered it yesterday within the framework of a press conference in Paris: "Europeans, I believe that one still showed it Sunday in the course of the day and the night, obviously interdependent, are determined, engaged to defend their currency and their monetary area." </seg>
<seg id="3"> Although quite relative, the relaxation recorded yesterday on the rates of the European government bonds brought water to the mill of the governments and ECB. </seg>
<seg id="4"> But one cannot speak yet about a beginning of standardization. </seg>
<seg id="5"> The Standard credit rating agency &amp\; Poor' s.a announced that it could degrade the note of the debt of Portugal, the target most aimed today by the speculation. </seg>
<seg id="6"> "Like in May, there is a real lack of clarity and of political visibility, which weighs in particular on the banking systems," the economists of Exane BNP Paribas estimate. </seg>
<seg id="7"> More especially as "political time is much slower than the time of the markets." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> Conscious of this hiatus and the dangers which it conceals, the European countries intensify the discussions to reinforce the already existing anti-crisis devices. </seg>
<seg id="9"> The abstract consultations between the Ministers of Finance most directly concerned and, more largely, with their pars of G20 go good progress. </seg>
<seg id="10"> And this altough for the meetings of the Eurogroup and Ecofin of the beginning of the next week. </seg>

<seg id="13"> As for the Funds European of financial stability (FESF), his executive director, Klaus Regling, began Tuesday in Singapore a turn of Asia to inform the investors natives of the Far East of the developments of the crisis in Europe. </seg>
<seg id="14"> If the objective of these visits is not rising of the funds, it prepares of it certainly the ground. </seg>
<seg id="15"> The first emissions of titles of the FESF are envisaged the next month. </seg>
<seg id="16"> Yesterday, an American official representative entrusted to the agency Reuters which the United States would support a possible increase in the funds mobilized by an additional direct commitment of the IMF. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="17"> The countries which are in first line, Portugal and Spain, as for them, prepare to adopt structural reforms, in particular as regards market organization of work. </seg>
<seg id="18"> Reforms which are added to the austerity measures for purpose more brought closer. </seg>
<seg id="19"> Lisbon and Madrid want to take a way different from those of Greece and Ireland. </seg>
<seg id="20"> One and the other make a point at all costs of avoiding requiring an international aid before setting up their own budgetary corrective measures and deciding essential structural reforms to give again confidence durably. </seg>
<seg id="21"> The European money-lenders, finally, discuss on the options available to accelerate the process of standardization of the sovereign bond markets. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Of passage to Paris, on November 24th, Axel Weber had the first advanced idea that if the 750 billion euros mobilized by Europe and the Funds international currency were not sufficient, the Union would not hesitate to give the hand to the wallet. </seg>
<seg id="23"> The economists of Barclays Capital, an actor of very first plan of the market of the European sovereign debt, judge that an extension of approximately 100 billion euros would be enough, "preferably" in the form of direct injection of liquidities. </seg>
<seg id="24"> The vehicle exists: it is the equipped European Mechanism of financial stabilization, to date, of 60 billion euros. </seg>

<seg id="2"> The WikiLeaks business has a double value. </seg>
<seg id="3"> On a side, it appears an apparent scandal, a scandal which appears as scandal only in front of the hypocrisy which governs the relationship between the States, the citizens and the press. </seg>
<seg id="4"> Other, it announces deep changes with the international level, and precedes a future dominated by the regression. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="5"> But let us proceed by order. </seg>
<seg id="6"> The first aspect of WikiLeaks, it is the confirmation owing to the fact that each file consisted a secret service (of some nation that it is) is made up exclusively of newspaper cuttings. </seg>
<seg id="7"> "Extraordinary" the American revelations on the sexual practices of Berlusconi do nothing but pay what since months could be read in any newspaper (except those whose Berlusconi is owner), and the profile sinisterly caricatural of Khadafi was for a long time for the artists of cabaret matter to sketch. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="8"> The rule according to which the secret files should be made up only of already known news is essential with the dynamics of the secret services, and not only in this century. </seg>
<seg id="9"> If you go in a bookstore devoted to esoteric publications, you will see that each work repeats (on Graal, the mystery of Rennes-the-Castle, the Templars or the Rosicrucian brotherhood) exactly what was already written in the former works. </seg>
<seg id="10"> And this not only because the author of occult texts does not like to make new research (nor does not know where to seek news on the non-existent one), but because those which is dedicated to the occultism believe only so that they know already, and who reconfirms what they had already learned. </seg>
<seg id="11"> It is the mechanism of the success of Dan Brown. </seg>
<seg id="12"> Idem for the secret files. </seg>
<seg id="13"> The adviser is lazy, and lazy (or of limited spirit) the chief of the secret services (if not it could be, which I know, writer with Libération), which regards as true only what it recognizes. </seg>
<seg id="14"> Information secret signal on Berlusconi whom the American embassy of Rome sent to the State Department was the same ones as those which Newsweek published the week of front. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="15"> Then why the revelations on these files did do such an amount of noise? </seg>
<seg id="16"> On a side, they say what any cultivated person knows already, namely that the embassies, at least since the end of the Second World War, and since the Heads of States can telephone or take a plane to meet with dining, lost their diplomatic function and, except some small exercises of representation, transformed themselves into centers of espionage. </seg>
<seg id="17"> Any spectator of films of investigation knows that very well, and it is only by hypocrisy that one makes pretense be unaware of it. </seg>
<seg id="18"> However, the fact of repeating it publicly violates the duty of hypocrisy, and is used to place under a bad light the American diplomacy. </seg>
<seg id="19"> In the second place, the idea that one to hack unspecified can collect the most secret secrecies of the most powerful country of the world deals a considerable blow to the prestige of the State Department. </seg>
<seg id="20"> Also the scandal does not put it as well in crisis the victims as the "torturers." </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="21"> But let us come to major nature of what arrived. </seg>
<seg id="22"> Formerly, at the time of Orwell, one could conceive all to be able as a Big Brother who controlled each gesture of his subjects. </seg>
<seg id="23"> Prophecy orwellienne had completely proven since, being able to control each movement thanks to the telephone, each transaction carried out, the visited hotel, the highway borrowed and so on, the citizen became the total victim of the eye of the power. </seg>
<seg id="24"> But when one shows, as that arrives now, than even the crypts of the secrecies of the power cannot escape control one to hack, the report of control ceases being one-way and becomes circular. </seg>
<seg id="25"> The power controls each citizen, but each citizen, or at least to hack it - elected official like avenger of the citizen -, can know all the secrecies of the power. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="26"> How can a power which does not have any more the possibility of preserving its own secrecies hold? </seg>
<seg id="27"> It is true, Georg Simmel said it already, that a true secrecy is an empty secrecy (and empty secrecy could never be revealed) \; it is true, as, as any knowledge on the character of Berlusconi or Merkel is indeed an empty secrecy of secrecy, because concerning the public domain\; but to reveal, like made WikiLeaks, that the secrecies of Hillary Clinton were empty secrecies means to remove any power to him. </seg>
<seg id="28"> WikiLeaks did not do any wrong Sarkozy or to Merkel, but in made too large in Clinton and Obama. </seg>
<seg id="29"> Which will be the consequences of this wound inflicted with a very powerful power? </seg>
<seg id="30"> It is obvious that in the future, the States will not be able to put on line any reserved information any more - that would come down publishing it on a poster stuck to the corner of the street. </seg>
<seg id="31"> But it is quite as obvious that with current technologies, it is vain to hope to be able to maintain the confidential relationships by telephone. </seg>
<seg id="32"> Nothing easier than to discover if and when a Head of State moved in the plane and contacted one of his colleagues. </seg>
<seg id="33"> How could the private and reserved reports be maintained in the future? </seg>
<seg id="34"> I know well that, for the moment, my forecast concerns the science fiction and is thus romantic, but I am obliged to imagine government officials which moves in a discrete way in diligences with the unverifiable routes, while being carrying only by heart learned messages or, at most, by hiding the rare information written in the heel of a shoe. </seg>
<seg id="35"> The information will be stored in single copy in drawers closed at key: at the bottom, the attempt at espionage of Watergate had less success than WikiLeaks. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="36"> I had the occasion to write that technology advances now out of crab, i.e. with move back. </seg>
<seg id="37"> One century after the telegraph without wire revolutionized the communications, Internet restored a telegraph on son (telephone). </seg>
<seg id="38"> The video-cassettes (analogical) had made it possible to the researchers in cinema to explore a film step by step, while going ahead and behind and by discovering some all the secrecies of the assembly, whereas maintaining CD (digital) only make it possible to jump of chapter in chapter, i.e. by macroportions. </seg>
<seg id="39"> With the trains at high speed, one goes from Rome to Milan in three hours, whereas by plane, and displacements which it includes, it takes three hours and half. </seg>
<seg id="40"> It is thus not extraordinary that the policy and the techniques of communications return from there to the horse-drawn carriages. </seg>
</p>
<p>
<seg id="41"> A last observation. </seg>
<seg id="42"> Formerly, the press tried to understand what was woven in the secrecy of the embassies. </seg>
<seg id="43"> Now, in fact the embassies require the confidential information of the press. </seg>
